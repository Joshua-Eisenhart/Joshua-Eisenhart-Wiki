# Contact Structure on S³

A contact structure on a (2n+1)-dimensional manifold is a maximally non-integrable hyperplane distribution. On S³, the contact structure is intimately related to the Hopf fibration and the geometry of qubit states.

## Core Structures

### Contact Form

A 1-form α on M²ⁿ⁺¹ is a **contact form** if α ∧ (dα)ⁿ is a volume form (nowhere zero). The **contact distribution** is ξ = ker(α).

On S³ ⊂ C², the standard contact form is:
α = i/2 (z₁ dz̄₁ - z̄₁ dz₁ + z₂ dz̄₂ - z̄₂ dz₂)

This is the imaginary part of the standard Hermitian form restricted to S³.

### Reeb Vector Field

The **Reeb vector field** R is the unique vector field satisfying:
- α(R) = 1
- ι_R dα = 0

The Reeb flow preserves the contact structure. On S³ with the Hopf contact form, the Reeb flow is the Hopf flow (the U(1) action of the Hopf fibration).

### Relation to Hopf Fibration

The Hopf fibration π: S³ → S² gives S³ a natural contact structure:
- The fibers of π are circles (the Reeb orbits)
- The contact planes ξ are orthogonal to the fibers
- The curvature of the Hopf connection (the Berry connection) is dα, which is a symplectic form on ξ

This means: **the contact structure on S³ is the horizontal distribution of the Hopf fibration, and the contact form is the connection 1-form.**

## Relevance to This System

### Contact Structure = Carrier Constraint

The contact structure on S³ provides the "horizontal" directions (perpendicular to the fiber) where state evolution happens within a shell. The Reeb direction (fiber direction) is the "vertical" direction that corresponds to global phase — physically unobservable.

The constraint cascade can be read as progressively restricting which horizontal directions are admissible:
- L0-L3: the contact structure exists and is rich
- L4: composition kills some horizontal directions
- L6: irreversibility kills reversible (Reeb-preserving) directions

### Connection to Geometric Phases

The Berry phase is the holonomy of the Hopf connection. The contact form α is the connection 1-form, and dα is its curvature. A closed loop in the base S² produces a Berry phase equal to the integral of dα over the enclosed area.

The system's berry_phase sims directly probe this structure.

### Result Evidence

`contact_structure_s3_results.json` exists in sim_results/. See [[probe-doc-result-map]] for status.

The currently visible `contact_structure_s3_results.json` artifact is a `classical_baseline` run with all checked sections passing. Any stronger transversality/nonintegrability packet beyond that should still be treated as a dated cited-update unless linked directly here.

## Open Questions

- Does the contact structure's non-integrability constraint correspond to N01 (noncommutation)?
- Is there a contact homology that classifies the surviving families?
- How does the contact structure change under the constraint cascade (does it become "more constrained" or "less rich")?
