# 2026-04-14 Sim Tranche — Axioms, Tool Depth, Gerbes, G-Tower, Motives, and Clifford Micro-Sims

## 1. Tranche snapshot

A large sim tranche landed in `system_v4/probes/` and the result-artifact surfaces.

In this maintenance pass, the safe public label for the new artifacts is `exists`.

Why the label stays there:
- I audited the newly written sim/result files directly.
- I did not rerun the new probes in this pass.
- Several result artifacts record internal fields like `pass: true`, `all_pass: true`, `overall_pass: true`, or `status: "PASS"`, and many also record `classification: "canonical"`.
- Those fields are useful evidence inside the artifact, but without a fresh controller rerun this page does not promote them to `passes local rerun`.

The main new survivor clusters are:
1. F01/N01 axiom micro-sims
2. deep tool-native claim sims
3. gerbe-family legos
4. G-tower reduction-chain sims
5. motives-family six-step packet
6. standalone Cl(3) / Cl(6) micro-sims

One informative divergence is already visible in the artifact layer:
- `system_v4/probes/a2_state/sim_results/sim_gudhi_deep_s3_hopf_torus_persistent_homology_results.json` exists, is marked `classification: "canonical"`, and records `all_pass: false`.
- Several adjacent deep-tool artifacts record positive internal pass fields.
- This split should be preserved, not smoothed.

## 2. Math worked out in this tranche

### A. Root-axiom micro-sims
The new axiom packet makes the two root constraints more explicit as bounded executable objects.

F01-side micro-sims now have result artifacts for:
- finite state set
- finite measurement set
- finite Hilbert dimension
- quotient well-definedness

N01-side micro-sims now have result artifacts for:
- generic noncommutation
- composition-order distinction
- identity via indistinguishability
- indiscernibility implies identity
- Pauli algebra closure as a joint F01+N01 carrier instance

### B. Deep tool-native claim sims
A second packet pushes specific tools into deeper bounded claims rather than shallow capability declaration.

Representative new probe files exist for:
- PyG Hopf/U(1) equivariant conservation
- SymPy Lindblad dephasing spectrum
- rustworkx Cayley S4 admissibility
- z3 no-classical-stochastic-under-dephasing/Weyl-commute fence
- GUDHI S3/Hopf-torus persistent homology
- torch deep Axis-0 autograd/von-Neumann-entropy

### C. Gerbe family
A gerbe-side packet is present as bounded steps rather than only as scattered higher-order geometry language.

Artifacts exist for:
- carrier/cell-complex side
- B-field/cochain structure
- reduction/coboundary side

### D. G-tower family
A G-tower reduction lane was recorded in this tranche, but the exact current artifact layer is better described through newer ordering and reduction result files than the specific three result filenames listed here:
- GL -> O
- O -> SO
- SO -> U

The `sim_gtower_full_chain.py` file also exists as the broader composition/probe surface.

### E. Motives family
A six-step motives lane was recorded in this tranche, but this page should treat the exact result-artifact census as dated until the current motives result files are re-linked:
1. carrier
2. structure
3. reduction
4. admissibility
5. distinguishability
6. chirality coupling

### F. Standalone Clifford micro-sims
Separate Cl(3) and Cl(6) micro-sims now exist with result artifacts for:
- basis
- rotor product
- bivector exponential / reflection / composition / invariants on Cl(3)
- basis / rotor product / spin-group embedding / chirality on Cl(6)

## 3. Tranche translation

In controller terms, this tranche is not one big "theory advance."
It is a widening of the bounded object inventory.

The main translation is:
- axioms became executable micro-legos
- tool pressure became deeper claim-local packets
- higher-order geometry families (gerbes, G-tower, motives) moved from broad naming toward stepwise packets
- standalone Clifford surfaces were separated into tiny basis/product/chirality probes instead of staying implicit inside larger pages

That is aligned with the repo's lower-first discipline:
- tiny local objects first
- bounded family steps second
- larger bridge language only later

## 4. What is already earned

| Claim | Evidence path(s) | Artifact-side classification/field | Safe public label in this maintenance pass |
|---|---|---|---|
| The tranche recorded an F01/N01 axiom micro-sim packet | exact current result-artifact paths should be refreshed before this row is read as a live artifact census | dated tranche claim rather than a re-linked live artifact row | `exists` |
| The tranche recorded a deep tool-native packet across PyG/SymPy/rustworkx/z3/GUDHI/torch | exact current result-artifact links for that row need refreshing | dated tranche claim rather than a re-linked live artifact row | `exists` |
| Gerbe family now has bounded result artifacts | `gerbe_carrier_cell_complex_results.json`, `gerbe_structure_b_field_cochain_results.json`, `gerbe_reduction_coboundary_results.json` | sampled artifacts record `classification: canonical` | `exists` |
| The tranche recorded a G-tower reduction packet | the live artifact layer should now be referenced through the currently visible G-tower result files rather than the three filenames listed in this row | dated tranche claim rather than a re-linked live artifact row | `exists` |
| The tranche recorded a motives six-step packet from carrier through chirality coupling | the exact current result-artifact links for that family need refreshing before this row is read as live artifact truth | dated tranche claim rather than a re-linked live artifact row | `exists` |
| Standalone Cl(3)/Cl(6) micro-sims are present as separated result surfaces | `system_v4/probes/results/sim_cl3_*.json`, `system_v4/probes/results/sim_cl6_*.json` | sampled artifacts record `classification: classical_baseline`, `pass: true` | `exists` |

## 5. What is still open

1. Repo ledgers have not yet been reconciled to this tranche in the same pass.
   - `system_v5/new docs/16_lego_build_catalog.md`
   - `system_v5/new docs/17_actual_lego_registry.md`

2. The public wiki still lacks dedicated current pages for these new families:
   - gerbes
   - G-tower reduction chain
   - motives packet
   - executable root-axiom micro-sims as a cluster

3. The controller has not freshly rerun these probes in this pass, so the new artifacts stay at `exists` here.

4. The deep-tool packet already contains an informative split (`all_pass: false` in the sampled GUDHI deep artifact versus positive internal pass fields in adjacent tool artifacts). That split needs a later bounded rerun/audit lane, not a summary-level smoothing pass.

## 6. One next bounded rerun lane

One plausible next bounded controller rerun/audit lane:
- `system_v4/probes/sim_gudhi_deep_s3_hopf_torus_persistent_homology.py`
- artifact: `system_v4/probes/a2_state/sim_results/sim_gudhi_deep_s3_hopf_torus_persistent_homology_results.json`

Why this one:
- it sits inside the new deep-tool packet
- it already shows the most explicit internal divergence (`all_pass: false`)
- it connects directly to the active geometry/Hopf lane rather than opening a totally separate doctrine surface

## 7. Optional dependencies

Optional follow-on surfaces after the bounded rerun/audit lane:
- `[[tooling-status]]` if the rerun changes how the GUDHI deep lane should be described
- `[[actual-lego-registry]]` and `[[lego-build-catalog]]` if the new families are promoted into the public inventory
- dedicated public concept pages for gerbes, G-tower reduction, and motives only after a bounded routing decision is made
