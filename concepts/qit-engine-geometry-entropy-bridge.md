# QIT Engine Geometry Entropy Bridge

## Definition
This page records the bridge problem between live QIT engine math, carrier geometry, and the cut-state family used for Axis 0.
It keeps the distinction explicit between what is already executable, what is still only a candidate, and what must remain open until the bridge is earned.
The bridge is not "entropy in general"; it is the narrow map from geometry/history into a bipartite density object whose cut quantities can support Axis 0.

2026-06-06 convergence correction: in owner-facing routing, `the QIT engines` often means the whole proposed stack, not just one engine runtime file. Read [[model-convergence-qit-engine-full-stack]] before narrowing the engine to a Lindblad slice. The full stack includes `M(C)` frontier, spinor/Weyl/density carrier, Hopf/nested-torus/Clifford/division-algebra geometry, branch/nonassociativity, terrain/operator schedule, Axis-6 precedence, and Type1/Type2 engine grammar. This page still keeps the entropy/cut bridge open; full-stack convergence language does not close Xi, Axis0, gravity, physics, or engine admission.

## Current v5 status note
Current v5 evidence keeps the bridge and Axis0 status open. The current sim-estate index admits several Axis0 candidates as formal-scout pressure, blocks `path_entropy` and holographic boundary/interior reconstruction as downstream candidates, and preserves the scalar projection blocker as `admitted=false`.

2026-06-04 carrier correction: PEPS/PEPS3D fixture language is stale for current carrier routing. CTMRG/PEPS3D is retired as load-bearing; current carrier surfaces are ITensors-MPS, exact dense/TensorKit, QuantumClifford, and spinor-native trajectories, with JAX and Julia primary in parallel. PyTorch/autograd, auto_LiRPA, le-wm, and graph/proof tools remain evidence surfaces only when a current receipt gives them a non-tautological role. None of these closes the bridge theorem.

## What the master table is doing
The master table partitions the stack into four different roles:
- root constraints: what the system is allowed to ask
- carrier geometry: the geometric substrate on which loop structure lives
- engine runtime: the executable update grammar and sidecar probes
- proxy entropy: operational quantities that are useful but not yet the final doctrine

Those roles are separate on purpose.
The bridge claim only becomes meaningful if those layers do not collapse into one another.
That separation is the same discipline used in [[formal-constraints-and-geometry]], [[constraint-surface-and-process]], and [[qit-engine-proto-ratchet-and-sim-plan]].

## Layer families in the bridge table
The master table can be read as a staged ratchet:
- layers 1-7: live base math for constraint, admissibility, carrier, probe, density, Pauli, and Bloch objects
- layers 10-17: live geometry on S^3, Hopf map, Bloch sphere, density reduction, nested tori, fiber/base split, and Weyl sheets
- layers 18-22: live engine grammar, operator family, and terrain scaffold
- layers 23-27: live proxy entropy, where runtime quantities are useful but still indirect
- layers 28-31: the open bridge family Xi, where geometry/history should map into rho_AB
- layers 32-34: Axis 0 candidates built from mutual information, conditional entropy, and coherent information

The table is not a theorem that the bridge is closed.
It is a maturity map for which subobjects are live, which are merely supportive, and which remain unresolved.

## Candidate bridge forms
Three bridge candidates are currently in play:
- Xi_ref: point-reference pullback from geometry into rho_AB
- Xi_shell: shell-strata aggregation over a local shell cut
- Xi_hist: history-window bridge that averages over a finite trajectory

These are not equivalent by default.
The latest bakeoff no longer supports treating direct left/right coupling as MI-trivial. Instead, direct `L|R` remains an honest control comparison, while a simple pointwise slice passes the fiber/base discriminator and a history-window candidate remains non-flat relative to the shell-flat control.
That is why [[axis-0-1-2-qit-packet]] keeps the cut-state bridge explicit instead of hiding it inside the engine layer.

## The status legend matters
- live base: already present in current probes/runtime
- live geometry: directly simulated as geometry
- live engine: actively used in executable engine code
- live proxy: executable and useful but not final doctrine
- live candidate: promising but not closed
- open bridge: depends on unresolved Xi choice
- proposal pressure: useful proposal, not canon

This legend prevents a common failure mode: calling a convenient runtime quantity "the answer" when it only serves as a proxy.
That discipline is consistent with [[axis-and-entropy-reference]] and [[entropy-sweep-protocol]].

## Why this bridge matters for this system
The system does not want entropy as a master variable.
It wants a cut-state family that is stable under probe, sensitive to coupling, and compatible with the engine geometry already validated in the live stack.
The bridge therefore serves three system-specific roles:
- it separates runtime proxy entropy from cut-state entropy
- it keeps shell geometry distinct from engine bookkeeping
- it tells us whether Axis 0 is a genuine bipartite functional or only a local heuristic

That is the reason [[quantum-shannon-theory-reference]] is relevant here: coherent information, conditional entropy, and cut-state structure are the candidate primitives, not a generic entropy summary.

## Executable evidence already in hand
Current probes provide evidence about the bridge problem, but not closure:
- `qit_graph_engine_alignment_probe.py` and its results file are useful as a graph/runtime drift-mismatch probe, not as a passing alignment witness or world-model closure row
- `sim_L0_s3_valid.py` validates the S^3 / SU(2) / Hopf / Bloch geometry spine
- `test_engine_dual_loop_grammar.py` shows explicit left/right state bookkeeping in the live engine
- `axis0_xi_strict_bakeoff_sim.py` is the strongest discriminator among Xi candidates

The key point is that these are different kinds of evidence.
Graph/runtime drift evidence is not the same as cut-state admissibility, and geometry validation is not the same as Axis 0 closure.

## Newly cited earned items in the 2026-04-16 packet snapshot

These are packet-snapshot items, not a fresh rerun audit performed from this page.

**Signed-cut support row cited in the 2026-04-16 packet snapshot**:
- A 2026-04-16 packet snapshot cites a signed-cut row for `I_c = -S(A|B)`, but this page should treat that as packet-cited support until the exact current result artifact is linked in the visible result set.

**Arrow-of-time support row cited in the 2026-04-16 packet snapshot**:
- A 2026-04-16 packet snapshot cites an arrow-of-time asymmetry row here, but this page should treat it as packet-cited support until the exact current result artifact is linked in the visible result set.

**Berry / Axis-0 support row cited in the 2026-04-16 packet snapshot**:
- A 2026-04-16 packet snapshot cites a Berry/Axis-0 support row here, but this page should treat it as packet-cited support until the exact current result artifact is linked in the visible result set.
- The cited packet snapshot treats the S² symplectic form / Berry-curvature relation as a bounded support connection for the Axis 0 gradient lane, not as a closed causal bridge theorem.

**Tensor-network support row strengthened** (`shell_indexed_tensor_network`, local shell-chain support row):
- At the local shell-chain level, shell order is load-bearing for contraction values.
- I_c is present in bond-cut results, and bond dimension χ acts as entanglement capacity in that bounded support row.
- This is a bounded local support row grounded by visible classical-baseline tensor-network artifacts, not a canon-closing bridge result.

These extend the bridge evidence to the Sp6 rung (Berry phase) and to the TN substrate. They do not close the bridge (Ξ canonical, A|B cut, shell/hist unification remain open).

## Key results
1. The engine layer is real and executable, but it is not automatically the final bridge.
2. Proxy entropy and cut entropy must remain distinct until a candidate Xi is selected.
3. Point-reference, shell-strata, and history-window bridges are not interchangeable.
4. The latest bakeoff keeps direct `L|R` as an honest control comparison rather than the deciding bridge row; point-reference and history-window remain the active discriminators.
5. The bridge problem is best phrased as admissibility under coupled layers, not as a universal statement about entropy.

## Open questions
- Which Xi candidate survives when geometry, history, and cut-state constraints are all active together?
- Is the correct bridge pointwise, shellwise, or trajectorywise, or does the system need a composite Xi?
- What minimal cut-state family is sufficient for Axis 0 without importing extra structure?
- Does the bridge stabilize only after a topology-variant rerun, or is it topology-sensitive from the start?
- Can the live engine sidecar be promoted from alignment evidence to load-bearing support for the bridge claim?
