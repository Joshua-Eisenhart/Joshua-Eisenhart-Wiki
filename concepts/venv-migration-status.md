# .venv_spec_graph Migration Status

## Overview
Date: 2026-04-05. Supersedes 4 venv-specific planning docs. As of that migration check, the move was assessed as complete, with the old directory considered deletion-ready pending owner confirmation.

Status boundary: this is a 2026-04-05 cleanup snapshot. Do not treat the interpreter/location claims as live without a fresh repo and shell-environment reverify. Current repo execution should follow the repo Makefile/process contracts, not the old `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3` wording below. A 2026-05-21 local check found `.venv_spec_graph` absent in both the repo and home locations.

## Migrated Skills
All 5 tier-1/tier-2 runtime skills migrated to /opt/homebrew/bin/python3:
- qit_graph_stack_runtime.py (line 71): migrated
- nested_graph_builder.py (line 93): migrated
- clifford_edge_semantics_audit.py (line 29): migrated
- toponetx_projection_adapter_audit.py (line 27): migrated
- pyg_heterograph_projection_audit.py (line 31): migrated

The 2026-04-05 migration check reported no known runtime blockers.

## Remaining References (non-blocking)
46 files still reference .venv_spec_graph:
- ~12 frozen audit logs (JSON/MD run records)
- ~4 Antigravity prompt batches (historical task docs)
- Various planning/tracking docs and readiness ledgers
- Legacy/read-only docs (core_docs/, system_v5/)
- 1 sim result (formal_geometry_packet_run_results.json)

Two dead-code constants in run_formal_geometry_packet.py:33 and run_root_emergence_packet.py:22. Not runtime blockers.

## Historical Deletion Checklist
Before deleting `.venv_spec_graph/` (~1GB), the source note required:
1. Confirm no shell aliases or .zshrc entries reference it
2. Confirm no launchd plists reference it (heartbeat already fixed)
3. Optionally remove the two dead-code constants
4. Delete the directory
5. Optionally archive the 4 VENV_SPEC_GRAPH planning docs
