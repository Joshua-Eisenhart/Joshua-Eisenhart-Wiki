# Holodeck, QIT Engines, FEP, and Leviathan Integration

## One-sentence summary

An intelligence architecture that maintains an internal predictive world ([[holodeck-doctrine]]), constrains it by lawful cycles ([[qit-engine-doctrine]]), updates it by prediction-first error correction ([[fep-and-active-inference-reference]]), and governs the whole system through explicit process boundaries ([[leviathan-framework]]).

## The Four Domains

### Holodeck: Internal Predictive World-Model

See [[holodeck-doctrine]] for full doctrine.

The holodeck is **not** just storage. It is an internal world-model where memory is compressed into generative structure, and perception is prediction-first: the model predicts, sensory input corrects the prediction through error signals. Identity persists through world-coupling.

### QIT Engines: Lawful Constraint on State

See [[qit-engine-doctrine]] for full doctrine.

A QIT engine doctrine is intended to exclude state transitions that violate admissible information geometry. Unlike arbitrary simulation updates, QIT-constrained cycles are supposed to be bounded by z3/SymPy-style admissibility witnesses. In the current disciplined reading, those witnesses are local proof surfaces, not a whole-world guarantee that the model is impossible to deform into incoherence.

### FEP: Prediction-First Error Correction

See [[fep-and-active-inference-reference]] for full doctrine.

The Free Energy Principle explains why the system should predict first and then update from sensory error. This gives the clearest interpretation for how memory can be reconstructive, compressed, and model-based rather than exact-replay.

### Leviathan: Governance and Process Ordering

See [[leviathan-framework]] for full doctrine.

Leviathan governs participation, sets process order, defines audit boundaries, and provides mirrors/accountability. The system's memory, perception, and simulation pass do not happen in arbitrary order; they happen under explicit control flow.

## How They Integrate

The stack forms a **perception-like intelligence**:

- **Leviathan** governs when holodeck, QIT, and FEP operations are allowed
- **Holodeck** provides the internal world that prediction runs on
- **QIT engines** are intended to constrain world updates by excluding incoherent deformations where local receipts support that exclusion
- **FEP** explains why the system predicts first and corrects from sensory error

The result is not a better chatbot or a retrieval-based memory system. It is an architecture where memory, identity, and perception run as one continuous world-coupled process rather than as separate subsystems.

## Authority and Scope

**This page is an integration hub**, not a complete specification.

- Each domain has its own standalone doctrine page (see above)
- The Leviathan repo docs (`docs/README.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`) remain the canonical runtime authority
- This wiki layer explains the world-model, constraint, and perception interpretation that the repo docs do not yet address
- Deep provenance and legacy history: see [[projective-holodeck-memory-model]] and [[holodeck-docs]]

## Safe Claims

- The four domains are logically compatible
- Together they form a coherent intelligence architecture
- The holodeck model is useful for simulation/game-world development
- QIT engine doctrine is intended to constrain arbitrary world-model updates; current proof is local and receipt-bound
- FEP provides the cleanest prediction-first explanation
- [[sophisticated-inference-active-inference]] provides external support for recursive belief-state planning, but only as analogy/support and not as QIT, Leviathan, or manifold proof

## What is Not Yet Claimed

- The full architecture is not yet proven by the sim corpus
- The repo does not yet implement all four domains as named modules
- Perception/consciousness equivalence is not established
