# Research Inventory and Foundational Findings

April source-bundle inventory. Treat findings as historical support and routing
context; current proof/status labels live in spec mirrors and live repo
receipts.

## Overview
This page records historical evidence-backed foundations the stack had simulated
in this source bundle.

## Foundational findings
- Density matrices / operators are central.
- Admissible probe families are central.
- Pauli and Clifford operator bases are central.
- Partial trace and CPTP/channel structure are central.
- Admissible geometry must live on the same carrier.

## Structural classes
The research inventory collapses into five classes:
- state representation
- geometry / metric
- correlation / entropy
- algebra / dynamics
- decomposition / compression

## Why it matters
This page is the evidence-backed inventory behind the build order and the equivalence-engine framing.

## External support traditions that match the remaining gaps
These are not replacements for the current stack. They are the best current support pages for the parts that still need deeper formal grounding:
- [[formal-methods-and-witness-discipline-reference]] for proof discipline, model checking, and fail-closed structure
- [[constraint-on-distinguishability-formal-reference]] and [[distinguishability-formal-reference]] for operational equivalence and probe-relative identity
- [[information-geometry-reference]], [[quantum-fisher-information-geometry]], and [[quantum-geometry-fubini-study]] for intrinsic geometry on the same carrier
- [[clifford-algebra-qit]] and [[operator-algebras-and-representation]] for noncommuting operator structure
- [[entanglement-theory]] and [[quantum-information-measures]] for bipartite correlation and entropy families
- [[schmidt-decomposition-bipartite]] and [[compression-to-density-matrix-map]] for low-rank and spectral truncation structure
- [[process-philosophy-and-relational-physics]] for relation-first framing without Cartesian residue
- [[nominalism-in-this-system]], [[nominalism-philosophical-foundation]], and [[nominalist-framing]] for the current translation layer

## Open support question
The remaining question is not whether these traditions are relevant. The question is which of them is load-bearing for the next layer of admissibility, and which are only explanatory overlays.

## 1) State representations at L0
Probe: `state_representations_L0`
Artifact: `system_v4/probes/a2_state/sim_results/state_representations_L0_results.json`

### Findings
- 9 of 9 representations survive L0
- top representation: purification
- most extensible representation to d=4: coherence vector
- density matrix remained a canonical base object in this dated fixture family
- eigenvalues are weak because they lose phase information
- Husimi and Wigner are lossy / smoothed views

### Ranking summary
1. purification
2. coherence_vector
3. density_matrix
4. bloch
5. stokes
6. characteristic
7. eigenvalues
8. wigner
9. husimi

### Interpretation
- purification is highly discriminating but not naturally extensible to d=4 in the same way
- coherence vector is the best bridge from qubit to higher-dimensional operator language
- eigenvalue-only views are blind to noncommutation and phase-sensitive structure
- smoothed phase-space views trade exactness for coarse geometry

## 2) Geometry families at L0
Probe: `geometry_families_L0`
Artifact: `system_v4/probes/a2_state/sim_results/geometry_families_L0_results.json`

### Findings
Surviving geometry families:
- trace distance
- Bures distance
- Fubini-Study distance on pure states
- QFI
- QGT metric part

Killed or rejected as sole geometry:
- Hilbert-Schmidt as sole geometry: flat, misses curvature
- relative entropy as metric: not symmetric, no triangle inequality
- real-only restriction: kills Berry phase and curvature, halves the state space
- commutative operators: kill nontrivial geometry

### Important geometry result
For pure states, the Fubini-Study metric and Berry structure are tightly aligned.
The geometry is not separable from holonomy in the pure-state limit.

### Interpretation
- the system prefers curved, complex, information-geometric structure
- flat, real-only, or commutative reductions are too weak for the full carrier
- Berry/QGT/Fubini-Study are all views of a coherent CP^1-level geometry

## 3) Entropy and information batteries
Artifact: `entropy_readout_packet_run_results.json`
Source packet: `entropy_readout_packet_run_results.json`

### Findings
- spectral entropy families on qubits agree on ordering:
  - linear
  - Renyi-2
  - Tsallis-2
  - von Neumann
  all line up on the tested spectral pairs
- diagonal Shannon is basis dependent and shifts under unitary change
- product-proxy conditional entropy in the current L/R engine adds no signal
- pure-state Fi blind spot is not fixed by switching among spectral entropies
- Renyi-2 tracks vN ordering on qubit mixedness

### Interpretation
- vN entropy is not “the only thing”; it is one member of a spectral family that often agrees in qubit mixedness ordering
- basis-dependent Shannon-on-diagonal is not a substitute for intrinsic state entropy
- conditional entropy and coherent information need the full joint / reduced-state structure, not just a local proxy

## 4) Correlation / cut-state / Axis-0 evidence
Artifact: `axis0_full_spectrum_results.json` and related readout packet

### Findings
- local-only L|R family fails: low/no MI, negative coherent information, not useful for quantum advantage
- Xi_shell survives as the strongest candidate in the readout packet
- Xi_hist_outer and Xi_hist_cycle remain candidate families but are weaker than Xi_shell
- coherent information is the signed cut quantity that matters in these runs
- some trajectories are only partially consistent with compression-from-future framing; not universal

### Interpretation
- the bridge family matters
- coherent information is structurally load-bearing for cut-state / advantage claims
- total correlation alone is not enough
- the system is sensitive to transport geometry and history-window structure

## 5) What the 161-family inventory means
The inventory is not 161 unrelated items.
It should be grouped into a smaller number of structural classes:

### A. State-representation class
- density matrix
- Bloch/coherence vector
- Stokes-like parameterization
- purification
- spectrum/eigenvalue view
- phase-space distributions

### B. Geometry / metric class
- trace distance
- fidelity/Bures geometry
- Fubini-Study geometry
- QFI/QGT
- Berry phase / holonomy

### C. Correlation / entropy class
- mutual information
- conditional entropy
- coherent information
- entanglement entropy
- concurrence / negativity
- Rényi/Tsallis/min/max variants

### D. Algebra / dynamics class
- Pauli algebra
- Clifford algebra
- channels / CPTP maps
- commutators / noncommutation tests
- left/right action asymmetry

### E. Decomposition / compression class
- SVD
- Schmidt decomposition
- principal-subspace truncation
- low-rank density approximation

## 6) Minimal foundational primitives suggested by the research
The current evidence keeps pointing to five irreducibles:
1. density matrices
2. probes
3. operator algebra (Pauli/Clifford/noncommutation)
4. partial traces and channel structure
5. admissible geometry on the same carrier

Everything else should be tested as a derived view or a candidate compression of those primitives.

## 7) Practical consequences for the sim program
The next simulations should not ask only “does this family exist?”
They should ask:
- what does this family reduce to under the admissible probes?
- what geometry does it preserve or destroy?
- what does it detect that simpler families miss?
- what is the correct collapse class?
- what survives the negative controls?
- what classical/numpy baseline exists for the same bounded object?
- what support does it run on, and is that support relation actually earned?

## 8) Recommended next bounded sim layers
1. collapse analysis of the 161 families
2. dependency DAG for the families, understood as a support-first manifold chain rather than a flat taxonomy
3. L1 carrier/probe fence tests
4. geometry cross-checks on the same state
5. entropy and information cross-checks on the same carrier
6. classical/numpy companion baselines where meaningful
7. axis tests only after the above

## 9) Research processing note
The wiki should treat the collapse classes above as the stable core, and route the deeper research through the support pages above rather than duplicating the same argument in every concept page.

## 10) Evidence status
This doc is evidence-backed by actual sim artifacts.
It is not complete, but it is real.
