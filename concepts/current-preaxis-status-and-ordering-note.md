# Current Pre-Axis Status and Ordering Note

## Overview
Historical snapshot dated 2026-04-04 (wave-2 updated). This is the broadest published pre-Axis snapshot note for that wave, but it should still be read as a dated snapshot rather than as evergreen live-status truth. It covers ordering law, what that wave recorded as live, and what remained open.

Current status boundary: this page can preserve the ordering intuition and April wave evidence, but it is not live v5 status. Current repo-side status belongs in [[specs/codex-ratchet/sim-estate-integration-status|sim-estate-integration-status]] and [[specs/codex-ratchet/formal-scout-readiness-status|formal-scout-readiness-status]].

Artifact availability note: `edge_state_writeback_results.json` was cited by the source note but was not present at the cited current-checkout path during the 2026-05-21 wiki audit.

## Historical April 2026 Ordering Law
Pre-Axis tiers must close before Axis 0 entry. Science chain: constraints -> charter C -> M(C) -> geometry -> Weyl layer -> bridge Xi -> cut A|B -> kernel Phi_0(rho_AB) -> then Axis 0. Bridge Xi is open. Cut A|B is open. Kernel is open. None are prose-closable.

This ordering should be read as a dependency/support chain inside one larger manifold, not just as a linear checklist. Later layers depend on earlier supports and couplings, and specific `runs on` relations still need to be simulated rather than declared. See [[support-first-constraint-manifold-dependency-chain]].

## What That Snapshot Recorded As Real Then

### B3 April Type-1 Operator-Basis Support (bounded; Type-2 unvalidated)
Type-1 fiber/base grammar crosscheck matches engine exactly. Graph artifact emitted: 4 operator nodes + loop-pair edges + cross-axis noncomm edges. Validator: 4/4 pass. Type-2 grammar inversion documented but not separately validated.

### C2 (VN Entropy Structure)
Purity-only proxy negative: KILLED on 8/8 VN-positive stages. VN coherent information is necessary. Status: keep_but_open.

### Hopf Pointwise Pullback
Fiber loops: density-stationary (constant pullback). Base loops: density-traversing (varying Bloch). Product-state I(A:B) identically zero -- confirms nontrivial bridge required.

### Kernel Discriminator (Wave-2)
K1_Ic (coherent information) wins: 5/6 vs K2_MI 4/6 vs K3_shell_Ic 4/6. Passes R1_signed, R3_bell_ceiling, R4_werner_monotone, R5_schmidt_sensitive, R6_cq_honest. Does NOT unlock Tier 7.

### Runtime Graph / Edge Writeback
Source snapshot claimed write-back path: 8/8 write hits and cited `edge_state_writeback_results.json`; that artifact was not present at the cited current-checkout path during the 2026-05-21 wiki audit. The snapshot also recorded 7/7 dynamic slot columns with nonzero variance.

## What Is NOT Closed

### C1 (Entanglement Object)
MI-based negatives still do not kill the counterfeit cases. MI is not quantum-specific or pairing-specific. On that artifact set, concurrence/negativity kill fake-coupling and mispair cases, but C1 remains open because no non-classical binding witness had been admitted.

### Bridge Xi
Open. In that bakeoff, the chiral family was still the least-arbitrary candidate and the strongest by the cited composite ranking, but that does not amount to full closure or all-rows positivity. History-window remains a serious competing lane. No single winner is selected.

### Type-2 Engine
Operator basis inverted vs Type-1. Probe is Type-1 bounded only.
