# G-Tower / Hopf / Weyl Integration

## Core claim

The G-tower reduction GL(n,C) → O(n) → SO(n) → U(n) → SU(n) → Sp(n) is a **candidate nested-constraint-shell structure** when the total space is the Hopf fibration S³ → S².

Each reduction step eliminates a family of structures that cannot coexist with the next level's constraints. Weyl spinors are candidate sections of the associated vector bundle on the surviving fiber.

**Status**: candidate claim, NOT a finished bridge claim. This page combines a bounded public follow-on with some newer result-surface synthesis, so it should be read as testable geometry-side support rather than as final doctrine. Bridge status (step 6) still requires stronger rerun-backed and controller-audited closure than this page alone provides.

2026-05-21 status boundary: the spec path has moved under `system_v5/docs/plans/plans/`. Several named G-tower/operator sims are present as source files but current repo indexes list them in never-run/review-required surfaces. Treat worker/result synthesis below as dated candidate support unless exact current receipts are linked.

## Key equations

### Principal bundle reduction
A principal G-bundle reduces to H ⊂ G iff a global section of P/H → M exists. On S² (Hopf base), controlled by π₁(S²) = 0 and second Stiefel-Whitney class.

### Associated vector bundle (Weyl spinors)
E = S³ ×_{SU(2)} V, where V = C² is the standard SU(2) representation. Weyl spinors = sections ψ: S² → E satisfying D̸ψ = 0 (left-handed Weyl equation).

### Curvature / Chern form
F = dA + A ∧ A = (i/2) sin(θ) dθ ∧ dφ. First Chern number c₁ = 1 (integral over S²).

### Holonomy
For a loop enclosing solid angle Ω: Hol(γ) = exp(i Ω / 2) ∈ U(1). Promotion to SU(2) requires double cover (spin structure). Structural link: G-tower step SU(2)→SO(3) ↔ fiber winding number observability.

### Connes distance
d(φ₁,φ₂) = sup{|φ₁(a)−φ₂(a)| : ‖[D,a]‖≤1}. In the current model, tightening on the cited 2-point spectral triple decreases Connes distance; the stronger S²/Hopf geodesic-recovery claim remains a separate target rather than an earned result on this page.

## Non-commutativity ratchet candidate

The geometry stack behaves ratchet-like only if order matters: if swapping shell composition changes the admissible witness set on a fixed probe, the stack is order-sensitive in a way worth taking seriously.

Current bounded evidence on this page should be read as snapshot-labeled result synthesis rather than as final closure:
- 10/10 non-commutative pairs confirmed (`sim_geom_noncomm_*.py`)
- order-swap probes were reported as passing on the cited worker/result surface
- Hopf ↔ Weyl ordering matters: `sim_geom_noncomm_weyl_then_hopf_vs_hopf_then_weyl.py`
- one reversed-ordering witness was reported UNSAT on the cited result surface; reversed G-tower order remains a dated inadmissibility claim in that probe family until exact receipts are linked

Safe framing:
- the G-tower is a candidate order-sensitive constraint stack
- if swapping shell composition changes the admissible witness set on a fixed probe, it behaves ratchet-like
- until that behavior is repeatedly rerun and fenced, it should be described as a testable claim, not settled doctrine

G₂ exceptional case: the currently cited order and reduction probes support the main chain, while G₂ remains the open exceptional case and may require a different probe family.

## Rosetta predictions (not yet confirmed)

Three tool-family pairs predicted to agree on the same invariant under different notations:

| Rosetta | Family 1 | Family 2 | Guard |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | geomstats holonomy | sympy curvature integral | z3 Chern number consistency |
| R2 | clifford Weyl grade | e3nn SO(3) parity irrep | z3 UNSAT L∩R=∅ |
| R3 | Connes distance (spectral triple) | geomstats geodesic | trace distance |

R3 specifically: for Bloch sphere states in S², all three distances should agree on pair orderings up to monotone rescaling. Disagreement = shell boundary indicator.

## Historical proposed targets

| Sim | Goal | Key tools |
|---|---|---|
| `sim_g_tower_hopf_canonical_connection_deep.py` | Chern number c₁=1 survives full GL→SU reduction chain | source-present / result-unverified in this pass |
| `sim_weyl_chirality_g_reduction_noncomm.py` | L vs R chirality projection before vs after SU(2)→SO(3) gives different survivors | source-present; one old result path located, not reread as current proof here |
| `sim_holonomy_connes_bridge.py` | U(1) holonomy and Connes distance co-vary on same loop families | source-present / result-unverified in this pass |

## G-Tower operator-family worker/result synthesis (high-entropy support, 2026-04-15)

This section is useful as a routed worker/result snapshot, but it should not be read as the page's own closure proof. Adjacent operator/coupling probes support the broader lane, but this section should still be read as synthesis-level support rather than a direct artifact census for the Hopf/Weyl bridge.

Shell-local operator families reported at three G-tower layers:

| Layer | Sim | Result | Key finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| GL(3) | `sim_gtower_gl3_operator_families.py` | dated reported full-pass row; current receipt unlinked | det(AB)=det(A)det(B); SL(3) is exact volume stabilizer (z3 UNSAT); gl(3)=sl(3)⊕center |
| SO(3) | `sim_gtower_so3_angular_momentum_operators.py` | dated reported full-pass row; current receipt unlinked | [Ji,Jj]=iεijkJk; Casimir J² central; ladder ops J± raise/lower; dim(so(3))=3 UNSAT for J4 |
| SU(3) | `sim_gtower_su3_gell_mann_operators.py` | dated reported full-pass row; current receipt unlinked | tr(λiλj)=2δij; structure constants verified; dim(su(3))=8 UNSAT for 9th generator; SU(2) embedding: 3 of 8 survive |
| Chain | `sim_gtower_entropy_reduction_chain.py` | dated reported full-pass row; current receipt unlinked | Entropy non-increasing at each reduction step; O(3)→SO(3) loses log(2)=1 bit (orientation); SU(2)→SO(3) gains log(2) from indistinguishability |

Receipt boundary: these pass-count rows are dated worker/result synthesis. Current repo indexes list the named G-tower operator-family sources as never-run/review-required unless exact current receipts are linked.

Safe read:
- the O(3)→SO(3) and SU(2)→SO(3) steps look like informative candidate ratchet sites on the cited worker/result surface
- they still need repeatable rerun-backed and controller-audited closure before this page should treat them as more than strong candidate support

## Topology tool integration (2026-04-15 note)

The 2026-04-15 page note said XGI hypergraph layers, GUDHI persistence, and TopoNetX cell complex on G-tower were launched with results pending. This pass did not link current receipts for those topology-tool lanes.

## Open questions (patient convergence required)

**Q1**: Does Hopf bundle support consistent spin structure under full GL→Sp chain simultaneously? (No multi-step probe yet — step 1 sims only)

**Q2**: Is Weyl chirality non-commutativity a fiber-alone property or does it require the full S³→S² bundle? (Next target: topology-variant rerun of Hopf+Weyl+torus on flat torus topology class)

**Q3**: Does Connes distance actually recover geodesic distance on S², or does Weyl restriction modify the bound? (spectral triple entropy coupling sim in flight 2026-04-15)

**Q4**: Where does G₂ fit? `sim_gtower_exceptional_g2_admissibility_probe.py` exists; unclear if G₂ is excluded or needs a different probe family.

**Q5**: related pairwise coupling probes support a restrictive interaction, but the exact Hopf/Weyl question remains open until the named probe is rerun or linked directly.
