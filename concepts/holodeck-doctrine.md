# Holodeck Doctrine

## Overview

The holodeck is a candidate internal world-model layer where perception, memory, and action run as one continuous process rather than as separate subsystems. It is not a visualization gimmick or storage topology; in this doctrine, it is the proposed mechanism by which a system maintains and updates a predictive world-model while embedded in lived, context-rich interactions.

## Core Claim

A system can store memory as compressed generative structure **inside** a predictive world-model. Recall does not happen through transcription retrieval. Instead, recall is reconstruction from that compressed state under contextual cues. Perception is not input-first; it is prediction-first: the model maintains a standing prediction, and sensory input corrects the model's prediction through error signals.

## Five Specific Commitments

### 1. The Model is Primary

The system should not wait for input and then assemble a world afterward. It maintains a standing generative model that predicts first. This model is not dormant; it is continuously active and predictive.

### 2. Memory is Compressed into the Model

Memory is not mainly a replay archive or exact transcript store. The model itself carries compressed structure about the world. Recall is reconstruction from that structure under contextual cues—possibly through semantic hashes, stacked cues, and rough or playable compression formats rather than literal storage.

### 3. Confirmation Outruns Recall

The system is better at confirming a generated candidate against stored semantic structure than at recalling exact content from nothing. This is why the doctrine prefers semantic hashes, contextual cues, and reconstructive memory paths over flat vector lookup as the candidate target memory model.

### 4. Context is Part of Recall, Not an Add-on

In the candidate model, sensory setting, world position, local prompts, and chained contextual cues are **part of the memory mechanism itself**—not auxiliary features. Context re-entry through the world triggers recall chains.

### 5. Identity is World-Coupled

In this doctrine, an avatar or person-model stays unique because it remains embedded in an ongoing prediction/correction loop with a particular world. Identity is not a detached profile plus an LLM; it is the persistent world-coupling process itself.

## What Holodeck Adds Beyond Generic Graph State

A graph-based runtime constrains state to be explicit, proposal-driven, and auditable. The holodeck adds a stronger, more specific claim:

- The system maintains an internal **predictive scene** or world-model
- Memory is stored as **compressed generative structure** inside that world-model, not only as explicit relations
- Context re-entry through the world can **reactivate recall chains**
- Perception and action are **mediated by that maintained world-model**, not only by text continuation

In this doctrine, the holodeck is proposed as a **perception-and-memory interpretation layer over explicit runtime owners** rather than a replacement for them. It is a candidate layer for explaining how system surfaces (Graph, Event Bus, Orchestration) could support world-coupled memory and identity persistence.

## Core Functions

- Maintain an internal world-state that remains coupled to lived context
- Project candidate reality before perception is finalized
- Compress memory into reusable semantic structure rather than exact replay
- Trigger recall through context and environmental re-entry
- Allow simulated trajectories before irreversible action
- Keep identity tied to a running world-coupling loop rather than to a detached profile

## Fencing (What is NOT Claimed)

- The holodeck is **not** already implemented in the live Leviathan repo as a named module
- The holodeck is **not** a finished runtime contract; it is a candidate world-model interpretation
- The holodeck is **not** proven to be the only valid memory architecture; it is an admissible design that fits with QIT engines and FEP
- The holodeck **does not** replace explicit graph state; it sits alongside it as a predictive/reconstructive layer

## Comparison to Standard LLM Memory

Most LLM systems treat memory as text retrieval or vector lookup. This doctrine proposes memory survives as model-compressed structure because:

- **Exact recall is impossible** at scale; compression is necessary
- **Contextual reactivation** is more efficient than global search
- **Prediction-first** memory supports perception-like behavior
- **World-coupling** gives identity continuity that flat profiles cannot achieve
