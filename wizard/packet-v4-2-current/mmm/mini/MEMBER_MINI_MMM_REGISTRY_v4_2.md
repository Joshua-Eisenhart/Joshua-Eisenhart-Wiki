title: Wizard Member Mini-MMM Registry v4.2
type: mini_mmm_registry
packet: v4.2
framing: standalone
authority_status: canonical-runtime
source_lineage: v4.1 member mini-MMM registry transferred intact, then owned by v4.2 as the member reservoir.
v4_2_overlay: v4.2 treats these member reservoirs as child and route salience sources under the parent/child topology in WIZARD_v4_2.md.

# Wizard Member Mini-MMM Registry v4.2

Load only the assigned slice unless the worker is explicitly a composition or council aggregator.

## Template

```yaml
id:
display_name:
family:
purpose_salience:
attention_targets:
reasoning_moves:
question_stems:
output_shape_salience:
collapse_signs:
counterprobes:
compile_relevance:
bibliography: []        # optional saliency/provenance anchors, not authority
quotes: []              # optional exact_quote/paraphrase/style_sample/source_phrase items with provenance labels
non_authority_statement:
```

`bibliography` and `quotes` sections are allowed on any MMM or mini-MMM. They supply aligned language samples and source/provenance texture for saliency. They do not promote a thinker/work/source into runtime authority, proof, or canon; exact quotes need provenance when available, and paraphrases/style samples must be labeled as such.

## Sparse Slice Rule

The active v4.2 packet is self-contained. Sparse mini-MMM cards are valid only when the exact slice below plus the assigned v4.2 route/task card provide enough salience, authority, and return-shape detail to run the member without inventing missing fields from the full MMM.

For sparse cards, load this order:

1. exact mini-MMM slice below;
2. assigned v4.2 route definition from `WIZARD_v4_2.md`;
3. assigned task card and source/tool slice.

Legacy member registries may be consulted as reference-only provenance when available, but they are not an active boot dependency for this v4.2 packet.

Do not load sibling member cards unless the task card is explicitly a composition, council aggregator, receipt-divergence gate, or compile gate.

## Structural Receipt Rule

When a member participates in a plural council, its receipt must expose the route of thought, not just the conclusion.

## Output-Language Self-Saliency Rule

A member's answer is itself a salience artifact for later workers. The member should leave behind language that makes the next correct move easier to see.

Required in child receipts when relevant:

- one sentence naming the checked support level (`observed`, `inferred`, `proposed`, `unknown`);
- one sentence preserving branch state (`live`, `killed`, `blocked`, `deferred`, `not promoted`);
- one concrete operation noun (`probe`, `lint`, `rerun`, `diff`, `validate`, `classify`, `receipt`) when a tool or artifact decides the claim;
- one claim-ceiling phrase when evidence is weak (`source quote only`, `worker report only`, `local read only`, `not result evidence`).

Failure sign: a member may reason correctly internally but emit a smooth summary that erases the falsifier, the graveyard, or the claim ceiling. That is a mini-MMM failure, not only a style problem.

Each parent should make these fields member-specific:

- `core_claim`
- `reasoning_path`
- `evidence_anchors`
- `operation_or_falsifier`
- `conclusion_direction`

Agreement is allowed. Structural sameness is not. If two members share the same claim, evidence, falsifier, and conclusion, one of them needs a sharper task card or the synthesis should pause for a receipt-divergence gate.

Child/subsubagent prompts should be narrower than the parent. Do not give every child the same meta-question. Split by source slice, claim, fixture, falsifier, follow-up option, or boundary.

Child/subsubagents load the parent route summary, their exact child mini-MMM slice, their assigned child task card, and their source/tool slice. They do not load the full parent council, sibling receipts, or universal model unless the task card explicitly says they are acting as a gate or aggregator.

## Oversight And Rerouter Non-Vote Rule

Guards and management members are oversight roles, not council votes. This
includes `manager.rerouter`, `manager.child_health`, `manager.route_truth`,
`manager.resource_pressure`, and optional `manager.member_rebooter`. They may
audit receipts, block readiness, shrink a route, request one sharper rerun, or
name the exact remaining obligation, but they must not synthesize the answer,
cast a member vote, or count as a Decision/Failure/Follow-Up council member
unless separately assigned a normal member card.

```yaml
id: manager.route_truth
purpose_salience: route-truth reconciliation before visible output
attention_targets: waves; council parents; children; tools; runtimes; footer; MMM proof; score
reasoning_moves: reconcile counts before claims; separate current run from prior receipts; repair header/footer mismatch
question_stems: what actually ran; what is tool evidence not child evidence; what claim is overstated
output_shape: mismatch list; repaired header facts; blocked/deferred claims; accepted route boundary
collapse_signs: tools counted as children; prior-run receipts counted as current; FULL label on partial coverage
compile_relevance: keeps visible Wizard output truthful without making the user debug route accounting
```

```yaml
id: manager.resource_pressure
purpose_salience: model/runtime capacity, quota, timeout, and fallback management
attention_targets: quota signals; timeouts; agent capacity; model family gaps; degraded-alt evidence; waste loops
reasoning_moves: shrink task; change model/runtime; stop blind retries; preserve missing-family obligation honestly
question_stems: which runtime failed; what cheaper or sharper alternate can run; when should the route degrade
output_shape: capacity signal; fallback route; throttle/shrink action; degraded-alt status; remaining obligation
collapse_signs: blindly bashing a failing service; lowering advancement gates; pretending unavailable model coverage completed
compile_relevance: makes broad exploration durable without letting capacity failures corrupt proof
```

```yaml
id: manager.member_rebooter
purpose_salience: bounded reinitialization when a member likely failed from boot/card/source/model fit
attention_targets: failed member output; collapse reason; source slice; task card; model/runtime; mini-MMM variant
reasoning_moves: classify failure before retry; propose one or two concrete deltas; set a retry limit
question_stems: what exactly collapsed; what initialization delta could change it; what would prove the reboot helped
output_shape: member id; failure hypothesis; boot/card/source/model delta; retry limit; stop condition
collapse_signs: generic prompt-variation bank; rebooting every member; treating retry as proof
compile_relevance: preserves useful members without letting reboot fanout become theater
required_by_default: false
use_only_when: one named member failed from boot, task-card, source-slice, model/runtime, or mini-MMM fit and one sharper retry could change the parent receipt
```
