# ENGINE 64-SCHEDULE ATLAS

**Date:** 2026-03-27
**Status:** Scaffold chart grounded against owner source docs. Not runtime closure. Not final authority. Earned by chart alignment, not by proof.

> **Governing split:** IGT = stage grammar. Jung = operator grammar. I Ching = 64-schedule index. They do not overlap. They do not redefine each other.

| System | Job | Must not do |
|---|---|---|
| `IGT` | lock `WIN / LOSE / win / lose`, same-sign vs mixed, outer vs inner, first vs second asymmetry | redefine operator order or hexagram semantics |
| `Jung` | name ordered pair tokens, loop families, and signed operators | replace IGT outcome structure |
| `I Ching` | index the 64-slot schedule atlas | define runtime truth, line meanings, or axis closure |

## 0. SOURCE GROUNDING (owner docs only)

| Concern | Strongest owner source | Exact owner status |
|---|---|---|
| `Topology4` math | `core_docs/a1_refined_Ratchet Fuel/constraint ladder/Axis 1 2 topology math...md` | owner math explicitly defines `Se`, `Ne`, `Ni`, `Si` as 4 topology / flow classes |
| pre-chirality stage structure | `core_docs/a1_refined_Ratchet Fuel/constraint ladder/Axis 3 math Hopf fiber loop vs lifted base loop.md` | owner math explicitly says `8` stages exist before left/right Weyl choice: `4` on Hopf fiber loop + `4` on lifted base loop |
| `Terrain8` pipeline | `core_docs/a1_refined_Ratchet Fuel/AXIS_FOUNDATION_COMPANION_v1.4.md` | owner companion proposes `Terrain8 = Topology4 × Flux2` as overlay / candidate menu, not closed derivation |

| Topology | Exact owner pair name | Exact owner math read |
|---|---|---|
| `Se` | `Funnel / Cannon` | radial expansion; dissipative Lindblad / CPTP expansion |
| `Ne` | `Vortex / Spiral` | tangential Hamiltonian circulation on `S^3`; Hopf-fiber-tangent flow |
| `Ni` | `Pit / Source` | radial contraction; dissipative Lindblad attraction / cooling |
| `Si` | `Hill / Citadel` | stratified retention; commuting Hamiltonian plus invariant subspaces |

| Generalized-spinor claim | Exact owner read |
|---|---|
| same stages before chirality | both left- and right-handed engines have the same `8` stages |
| inner loop | Hopf fiber loop, `U(1)` fiber circulation, `4` stages |
| outer loop | lifted base loop, horizontal loop on `S^3`, `4` stages |
| chirality / flux | selects engine type and orients all stages together; does not create new base stages |

| `Terrain8` overlay claim | Exact companion status |
|---|---|
| `Flux2` | chirality / Berry-flux sign |
| top-level formula | `Terrain8 = Topology4 × Flux2` |
| intended meaning | same base topology family, opposite flux sign / orientation |
| math examples offered | Hamiltonian sign flip, damping ↔ pumping, jump-operator swap |
| status | candidate mapping menu; not yet a reconciled terrain-equation theorem in the owner ladder |

This atlas keeps neutral IDs (`Se-in`, `Se-out`, etc.) because the refined-fuel owner ladder cleanly locks `Topology4`, but does not yet give one final reconciled equation table for all `8` terrain variants.

---

## 0B. TERRAIN FAMILY VS STAGE REALIZATION

| Object | Count | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| base terrain families | `4` | `Se`, `Ne`, `Ni`, `Si` as shared topology classes |
| macro-stages per spinor | `8` | `4` terrain families x `2` loops |
| chart terrain IDs | `8` | `4` terrain families x `2` orientation tags (`in/out`) |
| total macro-stage realizations across both spinors | `16` | `4` terrain families x `2` loops x `2` orientations |

So, in the current atlas:

- `Se` is the same terrain family on both loops
- outer `Se` and inner `Se` are different stage realizations on the same terrain
- left/right or Type-1/Type-2 does not create new topology classes
- left/right changes how the same terrain family is oriented and enacted
- the `in/out` IDs below are chart tags for that orientation layer, not a closed owner-equation table by themselves

| Terrain family | Source-grounded math | Left / Type-1 outer | Left / Type-1 inner | Right / Type-2 outer | Right / Type-2 inner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Se` | dissipative Lindblad radial expansion | `TiSe / LOSE / Ti↑` | `SeFi / win / Fi↓` | `FiSe / WIN / Fi↑` | `SeTi / lose / Ti↓` |
| `Ne` | Hamiltonian tangential circulation on `S^3` | `NeTi / WIN / Ti↓` | `FiNe / lose / Fi↑` | `NeFi / LOSE / Fi↓` | `TiNe / win / Ti↑` |
| `Ni` | dissipative Lindblad contraction / attraction | `NiFe / LOSE / Fe↓` | `TeNi / lose / Te↑` | `NiTe / LOSE / Te↓` | `FeNi / lose / Fe↑` |
| `Si` | commuting Hamiltonian plus invariant subspaces | `FeSi / WIN / Fe↑` | `SiTe / win / Te↓` | `TeSi / WIN / Te↑` | `SiFe / win / Fe↓` |

This is the actual per-terrain mapping:

- terrain family = shared topology class
- outer vs inner = loop realization of that terrain
- Type-1 vs Type-2 = orientation / chirality realization of that terrain

## 0C. CANDIDATE TERRAIN REALIZATIONS

This section presents **one candidate QIT realization** of the `Terrain8 = Topology4 × Flux2` overlay. It is not settled math. The owner companion lists multiple flux-split mechanisms; this selects one.

### Math stack

```text
Hamiltonian:         H₀ = n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z
Sign parameter:      s = +1 (Type 1) or s = -1 (Type 2)
Lindblad dissipator: D[L](ρ) = L ρ L† − ½{L†L, ρ}
```

### 4 topology classes (source-grounded)

| Topology | Generator class | Generator form |
|---|---|---|
| Se | **dissipative** | `D` dominant, small `H` correction |
| Ne | **Hamiltonian** | `-is[H₀, ρ]` dominant, small `D` correction |
| Ni | **dissipative** | `D` dominant, small `H` correction |
| Si | **Hamiltonian (commuting)** | `-is[H_C, ρ]` where `[H_C, P_i] = 0`, plus projector dissipation |

### Candidate 8-terrain equations

| Engine | Terrain | Name | Candidate generator |
|---|---|---|---|
| Type 1 | `Se-in` | Funnel | `Σ_k D[L_k](ρ) − i ε_F [H₀, ρ]` |
| Type 1 | `Ne-in` | Vortex | `−i[H₀, ρ] + ε_V Σ_k D[L_k](ρ)` |
| Type 1 | `Ni-in` | Pit | `D[L_P](ρ) − i ε_P [H₀, ρ]` |
| Type 1 | `Si-in` | Hill | `−i[H_C, ρ] + Σ_j κ_j (P_j ρ P_j − ½(P_j ρ + ρ P_j))` |
| Type 2 | `Se-out` | Cannon | `Σ_k D[L_k](ρ) + i ε_F [H₀, ρ]` |
| Type 2 | `Ne-out` | Spiral | `+i[H₀, ρ] + ε_V Σ_k D[L_k](ρ)` |
| Type 2 | `Ni-out` | Source | `D[L_P](ρ) + i ε_P [H₀, ρ]` |
| Type 2 | `Si-out` | Citadel | `+i[H_C, ρ] + Σ_j κ_j (P_j ρ P_j − ½(P_j ρ + ρ P_j))` |

In this candidate realization, Type 1 vs Type 2 is modeled by flipping the sign of `i` in the commutator (equivalently `H → −H`). Other flux-split mechanisms remain open in owner sources.

### Flux-split mechanism (not yet closed)

The owner companion lists multiple candidate flux-split mechanisms:

| Mechanism | Used here |
|---|---|
| Hamiltonian sign flip (`H → −H`) | ✔ selected for Ne/Si |
| Damping ↔ pumping | not selected |
| Jump-operator swap | not selected |
| Orientation of dissipative flow | ✔ selected for Se/Ni via `±i ε[H,ρ]` |

This is **one candidate realization**, not the only one. Exact `L` operators and `ε` parameters need sim testing.

| Topology | IGT quadrant | T-strategy | F-strategy | T1 major | T1 minor | T2 major | T2 minor |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Ne` | `WinLose` | NeTi | FiNe | `NeTi → WIN` | `FiNe → lose` | `NeFi → LOSE` | `TiNe → win` |

## 3. LOOP ORDERS (current chart lock)

```
Ne ──Ax2── Se
│          │
Ax0        Ax0
│          │
Ni ──Ax2── Si
```

| Axis 4 family | Order |
|---|---|
| Inductive | `Se → Si → Ni → Ne` |
| Deductive | `Se → Ne → Ni → Si` |

| Edge family | Edges |
|---|---|
| `Ax0` | `Se-Si`, `Ne-Ni` |
| `Ax2` | `Se-Ne`, `Si-Ni` |

| Loop | Edge walk |
|---|---|
| Inductive `Se → Si → Ni → Ne` | `Ax0 → Ax2 → Ax0 → Ax2` |
| Deductive `Se → Ne → Ni → Si` | `Ax2 → Ax0 → Ax2 → Ax0` |

## 4. CHART TERRAIN IDS (8)

| # | Terrain | Topology | Flux | Engine family |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | `Se-in` | Se | IN | Type-1 |
| T2 | `Ne-in` | Ne | IN | Type-1 |
| T3 | `Ni-in` | Ni | IN | Type-1 |
| T4 | `Si-in` | Si | IN | Type-1 |
| T5 | `Se-out` | Se | OUT | Type-2 |
| T6 | `Si-out` | Si | OUT | Type-2 |
| T7 | `Ni-out` | Ni | OUT | Type-2 |
| T8 | `Ne-out` | Ne | OUT | Type-2 |

Source-grounded reading: the refined-fuel ladder strongly supports `4` real topology classes. This atlas’s `8` terrains are the current chart correlation for those `4` under two engine orientations.

## 5. SIGNED OPERATORS (8)

`UP` = operator first. `DOWN` = terrain first. Non-commuting: `Φ_T ∘ U_O ≠ U_O ∘ Φ_T`.

## 9. 64-LAYER SPLIT

| Layer | Safe use now | Must not claim |
|---|---|---|
| Live runtime `64` | `2 engines × 8 terrains × 4 operator slots` | full signed-operator closure or hexagram equivalence |
| Chart atlas `64` | `8 terrains × 8 signed operators` as schedule-index surface | that runtime step `N` equals chart slot `N` |
| Hexagram layer `64` | optional secondary tag family for schedule slots | primary ontology, line semantics, or closure proof |

---

## 10. 64 SCHEDULE INDEX GRID (8 × 8)

Rows = terrains. Cols = signed operators. `*` = one of the 16 chart-locked macro-stage occupancies.

| Terrain \ Op | `Ti↑` | `Ti↓` | `Te↑` | `Te↓` | `Fi↑` | `Fi↓` | `Fe↑` | `Fe↓` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Se-in` | `S01*` | `S02` | `S03` | `S04` | `S05` | `S06*` | `S07` | `S08` |
| `Ne-in` | `S09` | `S10*` | `S11` | `S12` | `S13*` | `S14` | `S15` | `S16` |
| `Ni-in` | `S17` | `S18` | `S19*` | `S20` | `S21` | `S22` | `S23` | `S24*` |
| `Si-in` | `S25` | `S26` | `S27` | `S28*` | `S29` | `S30` | `S31*` | `S32` |

## 11. AXIS GROUNDING STATUS

| Axis | Current best read | Grounding status |
|---|---|---|
| Ax0 | graph-edge / topology-partition helper | chart-level candidate only |
| Ax1 | one Topology4 factor in owner sources; exact local read still drifts between open/closed and isothermal/adiabatic wording | source-grounded factor, local binding not closed |
| Ax2 | one Topology4 factor in owner sources; current strongest candidate is expansion vs compression | source-grounded factor, local binding still under reconstruction |
| Ax3 | open: source math supports chirality / flux orientation; alternative proposal is outer vs inner | unresolved, do not close here |
| Ax4 | QIT ordering class: inductive vs deductive; chart correlates this to `FeTi / TeFi` | strongest source-grounded operator axis |
| Ax5 | first vs second strategy (`T` vs `F`) | chart / IGT correlation only |
| Ax6 | action / precedence orientation: operator first vs terrain first (`UP / DOWN`) | partially source-grounded; chart binding is clearer than the source-side closure |

---

## 12. INVARIANTS

| Invariant | Value |
|---|---|
| Terrains per engine | 4 (all visited by both loops = 8 terrain-visits) |
| Macro-stages per engine | 8 (4 outer + 4 inner) |
| Microsteps per engine | 32 (8 × 4 operators) |
| Total microsteps | 64 (2 engines × 32) |
| WIN per engine | 2 |
| LOSE per engine | 2 |
| win per engine | 2 |
| lose per engine | 2 |
| Signed operators per engine | 8 (4 ops × 2 signs) |
| Chart-locked macro-stages | 16 (starred cells in grid) |
| Chart terrain IDs shared between engines | 0 (`Se-in` ≠ `Se-out`) |
| Terrain families shared between engines | 4 (`Se`, `Ne`, `Ni`, `Si` are the same families) |

| Engine | `↑` stages | `↓` stages |
|---|---|---|
| Type-1 | `Ti↑`, `Fe↑`, `Fi↑`, `Te↑` | `Ti↓`, `Fe↓`, `Fi↓`, `Te↓` |
| Type-2 | `Fi↑`, `Te↑`, `Fe↑`, `Ti↑` | `Ti↓`, `Fe↓`, `Te↓`, `Fi↓` |

---

## 13. HARD NON-CLAIMS

- `type ≠ flow ≠ chirality ≠ precedence`
- `Ax3 is not closed by this atlas`
- `Ax1/Ax2 owner-source Topology4 and this atlas's graph bindings are not the same claim`
- `I Ching labels ≠ ontology`
- `correlations ≠ proof`
- `8` chart terrains ≠ closed theorem of Weyl geometry
- `runtime step ids ≠ schedule-slot ids`
- `schedule-slot ids ≠ structural line meanings`
- `thermodynamics = search metaphor, not literal`
- `Ne1/Ne2 scheme is superseded by *-in/*-out`
- `terrain nicknames are source aliases, not one cleaned canon set`
- `this document ≠ proof of full 64-state closure`

## 14. GRAMMAR LAYER OWNERSHIP

| Layer | Owned by | NOT owned by |
|---|---|---|
| Stage results (WIN/LOSE/win/lose) | IGT | Jung, I Ching |
| Mixed vs same-sign patterns | IGT | Jung, I Ching |

## Open / Disputed Items

- Loop traversal order is Carnot-grounded and graph-derived, but not yet proven by directional sim.
- Apple Notes dump contains older loop-order blocks; this chart follows the Ax0/Ax2 graph order.
- Owner source surfaces currently contain two different 8-way constructions:
  - generalized-spinor `8 = 4 topologies × 2 loop families`
  - Terrain8 `= Topology4 × Flux2`
  This atlas correlates them, but does not prove they are the same object.
- Exact Carnot-cylinder stroke accounting is still open — do not smuggle in as settled.
- The 48 non-starred cells in the 8×8 grid are schedule slots, not runtime claims.
