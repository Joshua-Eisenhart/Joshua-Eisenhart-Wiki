# Tooling Status

Date: 2026-04-08
Supersedes: all prior tooling status docs
Status: dated tooling audit snapshot, not a live current-count surface.

Later recounts already exceed the `425`-file spot-audit size cited below. Use this doc for tool-role framing and the 2026-04-08 audit snapshot; rerun the sim-like file count before quoting it as current repo state.

---

## Scope and Boundary

This doc owns:
- the installed tool surface
- the dated tooling audit snapshot
- the role each tool is supposed to play in the stack

This doc does NOT own:
- whether a specific topic is already solved
- migration status of the 28 irreducible torch families
- live sim truth beyond the scope of the cited audit

Use it with:
- `MIGRATION_REGISTRY.md` for family-level torch migration state
- `TIER_STATUS.md` for resolution-layer status
- `TOOL_MANIFEST_AUDIT.md` for artifact-level tool declaration coverage

Short rule:
- this doc answers “what tools exist and how wired-in are they?”
- it does not answer “what claims are earned?”

## Canonical Interpreter

`/Users/joshuaeisenhart/.local/share/codex-ratchet/envs/main/bin/python3` — see Makefile `PYTHON` var for authority.

---

## Current Truth

- The stack is broader and more active than the older docs implied.
- The repo-level proof/graph/geometry tool surface is now real, but uneven.
- The current bridge / `Phi0` seam is still mostly numpy-first and underintegrated with the proof/graph stack.
- The basic foundations-first plan is still only partially complete:
  - foundational legos are now much better covered
  - bridge / cut-state / `Phi0` separation is now real
  - deep graph/proof integration into that seam is still behind

### 2026-04-08 controller spot audit

This is the current quick scan over `425` sim-like probe files in `system_v4/probes/`
(files beginning with `sim_`, `axis0_`, or `validate_`):

| Tool | Detected in sim-like files | Read |
|---|---:|---|
| torch | 134 | heavily present |
| sympy | 102 | heavily present |
| z3 | 100 | heavily present |
| clifford | 82 | strong geometry usage |
| rustworkx | 64 | present, but often in broad all-tools sims |
| geomstats | 59 | present, but seam usage still shallow |
| gudhi | 59 | present, but seam usage still shallow |
| e3nn | 55 | present, but seam usage still shallow |
| XGI | 55 | present, but seam usage still shallow |
| torch_geometric (PyG) | 55 | present, but seam usage still shallow |
| cvc5 | 54 | present, but still underused as a true proving engine |
| TopoNetX | 3 | clear underused outlier |

Interpretation:
- most tools are now present in real sim files
- not all of that presence is deep usage
- `TopoNetX` is still the clearest underused graph/topology tool
- the bridge / `Phi0` seam is still not where the stack is being used most deeply

| pydantic | (system) | Typed schemas | schema validation |
| pytest | (system) | Test gates | test suites |
| hypothesis | (system) | Property-based testing | test suites |

### PLANNED — Not yet installed

| Tool | Role | Blocker |
|---|---|---|
| Lean 4 | Interactive theorem prover (math formalization) | Separate toolchain install (elan/lake), not pip |
| TLAPS (TLA+ Proof System) | Temporal logic model checking (system properties) | Separate install, targets safety/liveness of ratchet spec |

### REMOVED from consideration (for now)

| Tool | Reason |
|---|---|
| DGL | Redundant with PyG unless PyG becomes a blocker |
| quimb | Tensor networks — not needed until Phase 6+ |
| qutip | Quantum toolbox — overlaps with hand-built legos; add if needed |
| ripser | Superseded by GUDHI for persistent homology |
| pySMT | z3 + cvc5 direct is cleaner than pySMT abstraction layer |
| HyperNetX | XGI covers the hypergraph need; add only if richer hypergraph analytics needed |

## Stack Architecture

```
PROOF LAYER
├── z3          — UNSAT impossibility, constraint logic
├── cvc5        — cross-check, SyGuS synthesis, admissible-operator search
├── (Lean 4)    — [planned] math formalization above SMT
└── (TLAPS)     — [planned] ratchet state-machine safety/liveness

GEOMETRY LAYER
├── clifford    — Cl(3)/Cl(6) geometric algebra
├── geomstats   — Riemannian manifolds, geodesics, curvature, Fréchet mean
└── e3nn        — O(3)/E(3)-equivariant computation on PyTorch

GRAPH LAYER
├── rustworkx   — fast graph kernels, DAGs, routing, dependency, causal-order
├── PyG         — differentiable graph computation, message passing
└── XGI         — hypergraphs, simplicial complexes, higher-order interactions

TOPOLOGY LAYER
├── TopoNetX    — cell complexes, higher-order structure
├── GUDHI       — persistent homology, simplicial/cubical/Rips/alpha filtrations
└── XGI         — (also here) simplicial complex construction

COMPUTATION LAYER
├── torch       — core differentiable substrate, autograd
├── numpy       — baseline comparison only
└── rustworkx   — (also here) performance-critical graph algorithms

SYMBOLIC LAYER
└── sympy       — algebra, derivation, symbolic verification
```

All layers are simultaneous constraint shells, not a sequential pipeline.
Every canonical sim must document which tools from each layer were tried.
That said, the current failure mode is no longer "tool missing." It is
"tool declared or imported, but not load-bearing in the actual seam under study."

## Current Integration Gaps

### Gap 1 — Bridge / `Phi0` seam is underusing proof tools

**CLOSED 2026-04-08** — `sim_bridge_phi0_proof_integration.py`

z3+cvc5 are now load-bearing on the Phi0 flip seam:
- z3 UNSAT: classical states cannot achieve I_c>0 at the flip
- cvc5 SyGuS: bisects flip boundary to relay=0.706180; UNSAT below 0.6562
- sympy eigenvalue chain confirms dS(AC)/dr<0 on [0.5,0.7]
- pytorch autograd: dI_c/d(relay)>0 at all tested relay values

### Gap 2 — Graph / topology tools are not yet central to the seam

**PARTIALLY CLOSED 2026-04-08** — `sim_bridge_phi0_proof_integration.py`

rustworkx 5-node dependency DAG (eigenvalue_chain → S_AC_monotone →
flip_exists → relay_lower_bound → phi0_claim) is now load-bearing.
geomstats SPD geodesic confirms no interior anomaly.

Still open:
- `TopoNetX` is still barely used (3 sim files)
- hypergraph / XGI treatment of multi-way packet relations not yet done
- cell-complex reasoning on shell families still missing

### Gap 3 — The basic plan is still only partially executed

The actual plan should be:
1. foundations as independent legos ✓
2. bridge families as independent legos ✓
3. `rho_AB` construction as its own object family ✓
4. cut kernels as their own family ✓
5. graph/proof integration on that seam ✓ (closed by sim_bridge_phi0_proof_integration)
6. only then promotion pressure

Step 5 closed. Step 6 (promotion pressure) is the remaining gap.

## Overclassification Audit (2026-04-08)

Scanned all `canonical`-classified result JSONs in `system_v4/probes/a2_state/sim_results/`.

**Reclassified to `exploratory_signal` (genuine failures or schema non-compliance):**

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `q3_bipartite_analysis_results.json` | `clifford_z_rotor_on_ket0` fails: e3_component=0.0, expected 1.0 |
| `z3_channel_boundary_theorem_results.json` | `test_single_qubit_boundary_strict` returns SAT, expected UNSAT |
| `xgi_torch_autograd_results.json` | No per-test status fields; `joint_kill_edges_in_top2_for_L4=false` with unclear pass/fail semantics |

**False positives (not real failures):**
- Files with `"error": <float>` — these are numerical tolerance fields, not failure flags
- `torch_constraint_shells_v2`: `z3_verdict: "FAIL"` is z3 correctly rejecting an invalid state (the negative battery test has `status: PASS`)

**Requirements files:** 5 files confirmed present — `requirements-core.txt`, `requirements-dev.txt`, `requirements-runtime.txt`, `requirements-security.txt`, `requirements-sim-stack.txt`. The sim-stack file is the authoritative list for the constraint-admissibility tool stack.

## Tool-Role Contract (expanded)

| Tool | Must do | Must NOT be reduced to |
|---|---|---|
| z3 | UNSAT impossibility proofs for structural claims | post-hoc SAT confirmation |
| cvc5 | Cross-check z3 UNSAT claims; SyGuS synthesis for minimal generators | redundant z3 clone |
| sympy | Derive formulas symbolically before numerics | verify-only layer |
| clifford | Native geometric product computation in Cl(3)/Cl(6) | roundtrip unit test |
| rustworkx | Fast graph algorithms, DAG ordering, dependency/routing/causal workloads | NetworkX drop-in replacement without using its speed |
| XGI | Hypergraph and simplicial complex construction for multi-way interactions | pairwise graph with extra labels |
| TopoNetX | Cell-complex topology, higher-order structure | Betti-number-only checker |
| GUDHI | Persistent homology, filtrations, topological data analysis at scale | unused import |
| geomstats | Riemannian metrics, geodesics, Fréchet means on shell manifolds | numpy wrapper for manifold labels |
| e3nn | E(3)-equivariant layers for symmetry-native PyTorch computation | decorative equivariance claim |
| torch | Tensors, gradients, autograd as core substrate | numpy replacement with same API |
| PyG | Message passing as computation, graph-native dynamics | graph inspection/visualization only |
