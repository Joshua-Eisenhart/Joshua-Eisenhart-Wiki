# Local Math Lego Ledger

Status: working execution ledger  
Date: 2026-04-11

## Purpose

This doc is the current working catalog of the legos the system needs.

It is not a theory essay.
It is not a raw sim dump.
It is not a bridge, Phi0, or axis plan.

It exists to answer:
- which pure-math or boundary legos must exist
- which already have a usable local anchor
- which still need deeper lego work
- which tool surfaces should be load-bearing for each lego
- which pairwise or coexistence successor each lego should feed next
- which legos are blocked from assembly even if they are useful

## Plain-English Notes

- `16` is not a math label.
- `16` only means this is the sixteenth numbered file in `new docs`.
- `lego` means a small, local, pure-math building block that should be simulated before bigger coupled or bridge surfaces.
- there are no “sub-legos”
- if one row hides multiple concrete math objects, those are separate legos and the row should be split
- If a row does not name the concrete math objects clearly enough, it is not doing its job.

## Authority Order

Use these surfaces in this order:

1. Machine artifacts
- `system_v4/probes/a2_state/sim_results/lego_stack_audit_results.json`
- `system_v4/probes/a2_state/sim_results/lego_coupling_candidates.json`
- `system_v4/probes/a2_state/sim_results/lego_batch_queue.json`
- `system_v4/probes/a2_state/sim_results/controller_alignment_audit_results.json`

2. Core execution docs
- `docs/07_model_math_geometry_sim_plan.md`
- `docs/08_aligned_sim_backlog_and_build_order.md`
- `docs/LEGO_SIM_CONTRACT.md`
- `docs/FALSIFICATION_SIM_DESIGNS.md`
- `docs/ENFORCEMENT_AND_PROCESS_RULES.md`

3. Everything else
- useful only if it does not conflict with the surfaces above

## Scope Boundary

### What Counts As Lego

- local or tightly bounded pure-math structure
- carrier, geometry, operator, graph/topology, bipartite, or boundary-falsifier work
- can be useful even when rejected by the two root constraints
- must be understandable without appealing to bridge, bakeoff, or axis promotion logic

### What Does Not Count As Lego

| Surface | Why It Is Not A Lego |
| --- | --- |
| `dependency_dag_and_collapse` | coupling/build-order analysis surface |
| `viability_vs_attractor_falsifier` | falsifier surface, but not part of the default lego ladder |
| `axis_entry_after_admission` | explicitly later than the lego stack |
| bridge / cut / kernel / Phi0 files | late-object or seam surfaces |
| bakeoffs / audits / packets / validations | controller or comparison surfaces, not foundational math objects |

## Build Rules

- A lego is local or tightly bounded. It is not a bridge, bakeoff, packet, audit, integrated pipeline, or axis-entry surface.
- Root-killed or rejected sims are useful. Keep them as evidence surfaces.
- A lego does not promote because it exists. It promotes only if the result is clear, scoped, and tool-honest.
- A tool only counts if it is load-bearing or clearly supportive in the real execution path.
- Pairwise and coexistence work come after the lego is real.
- Assembly does not consume a lego just because the lego passed once.

## Label Systems

### Lego Status

- `covered`: there is at least one good current lego probe
- `partial`: there is real lego work, but the lego is still thinner than it should be
- `needs_deeper_lego_work`: current candidates exist, but the lego is not strong enough yet
- `ready_for_pairwise`: there is already a real successor path
- `blocked_from_assembly`: useful lego, but not allowed to feed assembly yet

### Queue State

- `ready_now`: safe to run next
- `ready_but_supporting_only`: queueable, but current successor is still only supporting
- `blocked_on_lego`: do not move upward yet
- `blocked_from_assembly`: do not move upward at all

### Result Truth

- `exists`
- `runs`
- `passes local rerun`
- `canonical by process`

## Master Lego Ledger

## Bundled Rows That Should Become Separate Legos

These are not “sub-legos.”
They are separate legos that are still incorrectly bundled together in the current ledger.

## Doc-Extracted Legos Not Yet Fully Normalized Into The Machine Ledger

These legos appear clearly in `new docs`, but they are not yet cleanly represented as standalone lego rows in the current machine routing surfaces.

| Extracted Lego ID | Plain-English Lego | Core Math Object | Source Docs | Useful If Rejected | Current Relationship To Active Ledger | What Still Needs To Happen |

| `correlation_measure_family` | correlation and witness lego | correlation tensors, mutual information, coherent information, concurrence, negativity | `07`, `08` | no | partly absorbed into `bipartite_structure_local` and `entropy_family_crosschecks` | split local witness work from later entropy-lego comparisons more cleanly |
| `decomposition_compression_family` | decomposition and compression lego | Schmidt decomposition, SVD, principal-subspace truncation, low-rank approximation | `08` | no | not yet routed as its own lego row | decide whether it is a real lego or only a support method inside bipartite/state-representation work |
| `trajectory_viability_family` | viability-vs-attractor lego | trajectory geometry under repeated constrained evolution | `FALSIFICATION_SIM_DESIGNS` | no | currently outside the default lego ladder | keep separate unless it becomes a bounded local falsifier lego rather than a later dynamics surface |

## Current Build Order

1. finish the weak legos first:
- `constraint_probe_admissibility`
- `operator_family_admission`
- `entropy_family_crosschecks`
- `carrier_admission_density_matrix`

2. deepen the shallow tools at lego and pairwise stages:
- `pyg`
- `cvc5`
- `e3nn`
- `toponetx`

3. run the ready-now queue before new bridge or axis work

4. keep root-killed legos and falsifiers as retained evidence, not as discarded failures

## Commands

- `make lego-audit`
- `make lego-coupling`
- `make lego-queue`

Bot read-only views:
- `lego`
- `pairs`
- `queue`
- `sims`

## Bottom Line

The current program should be:

1. build or strengthen all local legos
2. force honest tool integration per lego
3. run the queued pairwise and coexistence successors
4. only then widen into topology reruns, seam work, and assembly
