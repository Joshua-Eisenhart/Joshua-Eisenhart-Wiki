## Question

Does some finite local automaton provide a weaker surviving presentation of the currently required constrained-
distinguishability dynamics than the installed global-map, density-operator, manifold, or other carrier families?

F01 motivates finite realizations. It does not by itself imply cells, a lattice, locality, a global clock, homogeneity,
reversibility, or quantum state structure. Those are precisely what this bakeoff must test.

## Root boundary

The input to the bakeoff is a finite constrained-distinguishability obligation and finite history, not a set of already
real objects or cells. A candidate earns cells only if stable local distinction bundles survive and a non-cell
presentation cannot carry the same obligation more weakly.

## Candidate families

Freeze at least one candidate from each applicable family:

| ID | Family | Additional structure it installs |
|---|---|---|
| C0 | finite partial distinction/update table | finite marks and supplied transitions only |
| C1 | finite-state transducer | explicit state and input/output interface |
| C2 | asynchronous local rewrite or event structure | locality without a global synchronous clock |
| C3 | partitioned ring/checkerboard automaton | cyclic adjacency, parity/block partition, alternating schedule |
| C4 | reversible block automaton | C3 plus invertibility/reversibility |
| C5 | bounded-degree evolving graph automaton | local updates with geometry/topology allowed to change |
| C6 | QCA/open-chain local-unitary fixture | finite local Hilbert/operator structure and unitarity |

Add rivals rather than choosing from this table when a new family may be weaker. The table is an initial finite grammar,
not an exhaustive ontology.

## Frozen obligations

Do not test “is CA good?” Test one obligation at a time:

1. retain a finite distinction under a supplied update;
2. exhibit a genuine order witness `U_B U_A != U_A U_B`;
3. preserve a distinction under finite perturbation/history when persistence is demanded;
4. reproduce only the locality behavior actually required by held-out probes;
5. make geometry/entropy co-views recompute from one altered distinction surface;
6. project to the current weaker predecessor without importing later labels;
7. remain killable by reachable controls.

If C0 or C1 closes the frozen obligation, a CA lift is nonminimal for that rung. Locality becomes a new rung only when a
named observation or constraint demands it.

## Ring-checkerboard hypothesis

The ring checkerboard is a strong C3/C4 candidate because two disjoint block partitions can support

\[
U=U_BU_A,\qquad \widetilde U=U_AU_B,
\]

with an observable noncommutation witness. Its installed assumptions must be individually attacked:

- cyclic adjacency;
- a fixed even/odd coloring;
- fixed cell identity;
- homogeneous local rule;
- global or two-phase clock;
- fixed versus evolving topology;
- single-token versus full-field configuration semantics;
- classical versus quantum local state.

The existing Codex-Ratchet evidence gives useful ceilings, not CA admission:

- `system_v6/sims/ring_checkerboard_automaton_v0/`: bounded classical single-active-token floor; its headline period
  ratio was definitionally forced, while a transient-SCC difference survived audit.
- `system_v6/sims/gcm_ring_checkerboard_runner_v1/`: frozen 16-survivor brickwork fixture; strict locality belongs to a
  separate ring-local variant; no full field dynamics.
- `system_v6/sims/ring_checkerboard_qca_v3/`: bounded open-chain crossing-rank fixture with opposite L/R signs; not a
  nontrivial finite-ring automorphism-class index or full QCA admission.

These failures and ceilings should seed the negative-control registry.

## Mandatory controls

In addition to the v0.2 general roster, the CA packet must run:

- phase-label and parity-label erasure;
- `AB` versus `BA`, phase merge, and commuting-rule controls;
- ring shuffle and same-size non-ring graph control;
- local rule versus all-to-all/global successor;
- fixed topology versus an evolving bounded-degree graph;
- single-token versus full configuration-field dynamics;
- synchronous versus asynchronous update;
- definitionally pinned period versus a statistic not algebraically fixed by the schedule;
- calibration/shift relabel rejection for QCA rows;
- finite open chain versus periodic ring, with boundary-dependent claims separated;
- resolution/alphabet/site-count sweeps without a limit-to-infinity claim.

## Weakness witnesses

Useful candidate-to-candidate weakenings include:

- forget the metric/amplitudes but retain the transition relation;
- forget cell identity and retain local event incidences;
- remove cyclic closure to obtain an open chain;
- remove the clock and retain a partial order of events;
- remove homogeneity and retain finite local rewrite rules;
- remove quantum phases and retain the induced classical transition structure;
- restrict full-field dynamics to a single-particle sector, never treating that restriction as proof of the reverse;
- allow graph adjacency to evolve, testing whether a fixed ring was ornamental.

Every edge must name the executable projection and show that the frozen obligation is preserved.

## Decision rule

The output is the set of all tested surviving candidates with no strictly weaker tested survivor. It may be plural.

Allowed statement:

> Within CA grammar hash `g`, weakening grammar hash `w`, tests `b`, resolution `r`, and budget `k`, candidates
> `{...}` form the current minimal-survivor frontier.

Forbidden statement:

> Finitude proves the universe is this CA.

## First bounded packet

1. Express one existing ring-checkerboard N01 obligation as a carrier-neutral finite distinction/history table.
2. Implement C0, C2, C3, and C5 against exactly that table and budget.
3. Register explicit forgetting maps and compute the frontier with `ratchet_kernel.py`.
4. Run the mandatory controls, especially topology, clock, single-token/full-field, and definitionally fixed-period tests.
5. Emit a `ratchet-run/0.2` receipt with all open attacks.
6. Only if locality survives as load-bearing should C4 or C6 be proposed as the next minimal lift.
