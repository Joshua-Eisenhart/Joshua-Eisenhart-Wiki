run_all.py -- deterministic verification harness for the constraint-core bundle.

Usage:  python3 run_all.py            (exit 0 = all checks green, 1 = failure)
        python3 run_all.py --fast     (skip the two JAX sims even if jax exists)

Every sim is standalone; this harness runs each one and asserts its HEADLINE
INVARIANTS against expected values with explicit tolerances. Two check types:
  contains: literal substring must appear in stdout
  approx:   regex captures a float; |value - expected| <= tol

IMPORTANT FOR AGENTS: some expected values are HONEST FAILURES (e.g. the Axis-0
entropy doctrine must remain False; the order-blind collapse must remain 11/64).
A run that makes those "pass" by flipping them is a REGRESSION. Never edit an
expected value to make a check green -- a mismatch is a finding to report.

(3) UMEGAKI IN A FORCED FAMILY: every operator-convex f with f(1)=0 gives a monotone quasi-entropy; all 4 members (x log x, -log x, (x-1)^2, 2(1-sqrt x)) pawl uniformly to 0 -- Umegaki is ONE member, not a hand-picked choice.

Controls: corrupted-Fano single sign-flip collapses F4 to 3 (52 is a genuine consequence of the exact octonion structure); generic non-idempotent diag(3,2,1) gives a different 28/24 split (36/16 specific to primitive idempotents = points of OP2).

Reference detector valid (Im(O)->malcev_not_lie, Im(H)->lie, random-R7->neither, corrupted-sign->neither).

The attachments CONFLATE non-factorizable ENTROPY (holism, associative, doesn't force O) with non-associative ALGEBRA (octonions).
