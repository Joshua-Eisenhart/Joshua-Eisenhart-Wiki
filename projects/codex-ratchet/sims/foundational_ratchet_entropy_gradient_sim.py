"""foundational_ratchet_entropy_gradient -- the ratchet MECHANISM itself, built at the foundations, following the
ratchet's OWN RULES: the constraint on distinguishability generates DEMANDS, MSS is the admissibility CONSTRAINT
(admit only forced structure, a pawl rejects the unforced), and geometry+entropy co-ratchet ONE-FOR-ONE.

QUARANTINE_EXPLORATORY. classification="scratch_diagnostic". promotion_allowed=False.

THE CORRECTION THIS ENCODES (owner, 2026-07-05): "not saying literally all begins at axis0. rather to actually
follow my ratchets rules and work out axis0 early. not later. and do the coratchet. and understand mss as part of
the constraints. jumping to bits and vectors, shows exactly the process not being done." So:
  - Axis-0 (the distinguishability gap) is worked EARLY, as part of the co-ratchet -- not a late readout.
  - MSS is NOT a preference ("pick the smallest gain"). It is a CONSTRAINT on admissibility: a step may add only
    the structure a live DEMAND forces. A step that presumes structure no demand forces is INADMISSIBLE -- the
    PAWL rejects it (no unforced climb). "Smallest leap" is not chosen; larger leaps are ruled out.
  - NO BITS, NO VECTORS. Both smuggle unearned structure (a measure; an algebra). Everything is built from the
    constraint on distinguishability (a=a iff a~b), measured as quantum distinguishability (trace distance).

THE FOUNDATIONS, PRESUMING THE LEAST (order aligned with the constraints, not prescribed):
  ROOT CONSTRAINTS: F01 finitude (finitely many distinguishable things; a finite probe ladder), N01
                    noncommutation (the probes/bases noncommute -- order and basis matter). Nothing else assumed.
  STATIC FUZZ:      a field of possibilities; frames carry no information between them.
  MINIMAL PERSISTENT EVOLVING STRUCTURE: the least thing that persists AND evolves between fuzz frames under
                    F01+N01 is a NORM-PRESERVING carrier (a unit state in a finite complex space -- a spinor).
                    A non-norm-preserving thing either vanishes or blows up across frames; only the unit-norm
                    carrier persists. (earned prior: persistence_is_norm_preserving.)
  THE DEMAND (what the constraint on distinguishability GENERATES): a pair of admissible futures that ARE
                    distinguishable (trace distance > theta) but which the carrier's ACQUIRED bases do NOT yet
                    resolve (best achievable < a fraction of what is available). An unmet demand is the
                    constraint a=a iff a~b speaking: two things the room says are different that the carrier
                    cannot yet tell apart. Demands are what force teeth.
  MSS AS CONSTRAINT: the admissible step is to acquire the WEAKEST basis that closes >=1 open demand -- weakest =
                    closes the FEWEST demands (adds the least resolving power, presumes the least). If NO demand
                    is open, NO acquisition is admissible: the PAWL holds (proven, not asserted, by showing every
                    candidate basis is rejected-unforced). This is the wheel-and-pawl: the demand is the tooth,
                    MSS-admissibility is the pawl.
  THE ENTROPY GRADIENT = AXIS-0, AT THE FLOOR, AS A DISTINGUISHABILITY (owner: "bits are classical"; "bits
                    presume too much"). The measure is QUANTUM DISTINGUISHABILITY -- trace distance / Helstrom --
                    NEVER bits, log2, or counting of microstates (entropy is the LATER measure the doc names, not
                    the substance). Two faces, per the owner's positive/negative-entropy split: AVAILABLE
                    distinguishability the growing possibility space offers (positive-entropy face, opening) vs
                    RESOLVED distinguishability the carrier's acquired measurement bases can access (negative-
                    entropy face, binding). AXIS-0 = the GAP available - resolved. It is not injected; it is
                    constitutive of a growing possibility space. This gap is the ratchet DRIVE.
  CO-RATCHET (geometry == entropy, ONE thing): the carrier's structural climb (geometry: how much distinguishing
                    capacity it has acquired) and the entropy gradient (the distinguishability gap) are the SAME
                    object read two ways -- they must move one-for-one. Measured here, not asserted.
  MSS CLIMB: driven by the gradient, the carrier climbs by the SMALLEST step that resolves a forced distinction
                    (weakest capacity that separates one more pair the growth just made distinguishable).

THE KILLER CONTROL (Feynman): FREEZE the growth of the possibility space. The gradient closes; the drive
  vanishes; the ratchet must STOP once the carrier catches the (now static) ceiling. If the climb continues
  without growth, the drive was not the gradient and the whole picture is wrong. If it halts, the entropy
  gradient at the foundation IS the drive -- Axis-0 earned at the floor.
