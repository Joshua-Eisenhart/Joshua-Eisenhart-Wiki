"""win_lose_as_known_unknown_fep_sim -- WIN/LOSE is ONE frame; KNOWN/UNKNOWN is another. This sim tests WHERE the
reframe actually holds and records honestly where it does NOT.

THE OWNER'S REFRAME. Win/lose (IGT) is a game-theoretic lens; known/unknown is an epistemic lens, and it maps
naturally onto FEP (surprise = the measure of the unknown). Two levels were tested:

  (A) PER-STAGE (hypothesis: win-labeled stages reduce surprise toward their terrain pointer more than lose-labeled).
      FALSIFIED -- reported, not gated. Measured surprise-reduction dS = S(rho_in||goal) - S(rho_out||goal) (Umegaki
      bits, goal = terrain GKSL pointer) per Type-1 stage, partitioned by the doc win/lose label. The win-group mean
      (0.615 bits) is LOWER than the lose-group (1.009), separation -0.393, which does NOT beat the shuffled-label
      control (|sep| ~0.32) or the wrong-goal control (-0.405). The per-stage surprise-reduction is dominated by
      OPERATOR FAMILY (T-pinches reduce surprise more than F-rotations = Axis-5), NOT by the win/lose label. So
      win/lose does NOT reduce to a per-stage FEP surprise readout. Honest negative result.

  (B) METHOD-LEVEL / DIRECTIONAL (the reframe that DOES hold, and is gated). The real known/unknown structure is
      DIRECTIONAL, not per-stage: the two engine loops are two science methods --
        Type-1 = candidate-first confirmation  = TEST THE KNOWN (declare a candidate, survive counter-projection),
        Type-2 = measurement-first reconstruction = EXPLORE THE UNKNOWN (start from a view, build a candidate).
      This is the v7 qit_bidirectional_science_type1_type2_v0 result, corroborated here from its measured teeth:
        Type-1 accuracy 1.0, wrong-candidate rejected (it tests the known well);
        Type-2 accuracy 0.9, but erased-controls collapse to chance 0.25 (it explores the unknown, ambiguous on
        underdetermined single-view buckets).
      The win table (Type-1-only wins vs Type-2-only vs shared) is itself the win/lose frame; the known/unknown frame
      is the SAME comparison read epistemically (confirm vs explore). That is why win/lose "works well for FEP": at
      the METHOD level the two frames are one structure -- confirm=exploit-the-known, explore=reduce-the-unknown.

GATE: the method-level duality holds iff (Type-1 tests-the-known: high nominal accuracy AND rejects wrong candidates)
AND (Type-2 explores-the-unknown: nominal accuracy well above its erased controls). CONTROL that can fail: if
Type-2's erased controls were NOT at chance (i.e. it "reconstructs" even with the measurement bag erased), it would
not be genuinely exploring the unknown, and the duality would be a relabeling -- the v7 gates check exactly this.
If the v7 result is absent the method-level check is SKIPPED (the per-stage negative result still prints).

scratch_diagnostic, promotion_allowed=false. Records a real negative (per-stage) and a real positive (method-level).
