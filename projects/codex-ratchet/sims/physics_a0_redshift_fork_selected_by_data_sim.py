"""physics_a0_redshift_fork_selected_by_data -- the model FORCES a fork on the dark-sector acceleration scale's
cosmic-time evolution; external high-z rotation-curve data KILLS one branch. The constraint does real work.

CONTEXT. UP-134 predicted the dark-sector acceleration scale a0 = c*H0/(2*pi) from the model's dark-energy-first
cosmogenesis (Axis-0 = gradient to a rising ceiling, tied to the expansion rate) + its Unruh 2*pi. That prediction has
a distinctive, NEW, falsifiable consequence that plain constant-a0 MOND does not make: if a0 is set by "the growing
room" rate, then whether a0 EVOLVES with redshift depends on WHICH rate the growing room is. The model forces a fork:

  Branch A -- the growing-room rate = the TOTAL expansion rate H(z) = H0*sqrt(Om*(1+z)^3 + OL). Then a0 RUNS:
             a0(z) = c*H(z)/(2*pi), rising as (1+z)^(3/2) at high z.
  Branch B -- the growing-room rate = the DARK-ENERGY / de Sitter horizon rate (the "dark energy came first" reading,
             the rate the expansion asymptotes to under Lambda). Then a0 is ~CONSTANT in cosmic time.

These agree at z=0 (both give the established a0 ~ c*H0/2pi coincidence, ratio 0.90 to the observed 1.2e-10) but
DIVERGE at high z: Branch A predicts a0(z=2) ~ 2.97*a0(0); Branch B predicts a0(z=2) ~ a0(0).

EXTERNAL DATA SELECTS THE BRANCH. Genzel et al. 2017 (Nature; arXiv:1703.04310) measured falling, strongly
baryon-dominated rotation curves for six massive disc galaxies at z~0.9-2.4. Milgrom 2017 (arXiv:1703.06110) analyzed
these in MOND; as reported (attribution, not a verified verbatim quote -- title/URL confirmed via search, exact page
wording not in this environment's transcript) that analysis constrains variation of the MOND a0 with cosmic time,
disfavouring a large increase (order ~4a0) by z~2 and specifically a scaling a0 proportional to (1+z)^(3/2), with the
data consistent with a CONSTANT a0. Taking that reported exclusion at face value, Branch A (a0 ~ (1+z)^3/2 at high z,
~2.97*a0 at z=2) is FALSIFIED, and Branch B (constant a0) survives -- selecting the DARK-ENERGY-horizon reading of the
model's own cosmogenesis. The gate below tests the MODEL-side numbers (that Branch A lands in the disfavoured region and
Branch B does not); the external exclusion itself is cited, not re-derived here.

GATED CLAIMS (external data; controls must FAIL):
  (1) THE FORK IS REAL AND FORCED: the two branches agree at z=0 (ratio to observed a0 both ~0.90, within the H0
      spread) but diverge by a factor > 1.5 at z=2 -- so it is a genuine, testable discriminator, not a local ambiguity.
  (2) DATA KILLS BRANCH A: Branch A's high-z scaling is a0 ~ (1+z)^(3/2) (verified: fitted log-log slope of a0(z) vs
      (1+z) approaches 1.5 at high z), and a0(z=2)/a0(0) ~ 3, both in the range Milgrom 2017 reports the Genzel data
      EXCLUDES. A "no expansion" control (H(z)=H0) collapses the discriminator to 1.0 (no test) -- proving the
      discriminator genuinely comes from cosmic evolution, not arithmetic.
  (3) BRANCH B SURVIVES AND IS THE REFINEMENT: Branch B is constant in z (a0(z)/a0(0)=1 to machine precision),
      consistent with the observed lack of a0 evolution; it keeps the z=0 match (ratio ~0.90). This refines UP-134:
      the growing-room rate is the dark-energy/de Sitter horizon, not the total expansion rate.

HONEST SCOPE: this does not confirm the model; it shows the model makes a distinguishing prediction, and external data
adjudicates the internal fork -- killing the total-expansion reading and selecting the dark-energy-horizon reading
(which is also Milgrom's own preferred constant-a0). The Genzel/Milgrom exclusion values are quoted from the cited
papers; this sim reproduces the model-side numbers (a0(z) for each branch) that meet those external bounds. Owner
doctrine under test.

scratch_diagnostic, promotion_allowed=false. External inputs: c (exact), H0 + (Om,OL) flat-LCDM, observed MOND a0,
and the Genzel 2017 / Milgrom 2017 high-z exclusion (a0 !~ 4a0 at z~2; a0 !~ (1+z)^1.5).
