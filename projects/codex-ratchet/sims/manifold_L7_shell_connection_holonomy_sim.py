"""manifold_L7_shell_connection_holonomy_sim.py -- PURE MATH. 2026-07-09, Manifold spine Layer 7 (L7).

Nests on L6 (the monotone BKM metric on the shell family) and L5 (nested-shell Schmidt strata) and L3 (spinor/phase
surface). L5 gave the nested shells and asserted a flux Phi=2pi(cos2eta_i-cos2eta_j) between them as a bare NUMBER
(ledger L2.1). L6 gave the shells a metric. L7 adds (completeness contract Part A, layer 7) the CONNECTION: a rule for
PARALLEL-TRANSPORTING the spinor phase across shells, whose holonomy DERIVES that flux as a covariant object rather
than positing it. This is where the model's "flux" stops being a formula and becomes the curvature of a connection.

Motivation (paraphrase, not a verbatim quote): continue looping on the foundations, building spine rungs forward while
looping back to strengthen the earlier ones.

WHAT L7 ADDS OVER L5/L6 (the forcing content):
 (1) THE FLUX IS A BERRY HOLONOMY (derived, not posited). Using the Hopf chart |psi(phi,eta)>=(cos eta e^{i phi}, sin
     eta) that L3 already established, the Berry connection A=i<psi|dpsi> parallel-transported around the phi-loop at
     fixed eta gives holonomy -2pi cos^2(eta), matching the analytic value to ~1e-6 (discrete transport) / 1e-15
     (special angles). The flux BETWEEN two nested shells is the DIFFERENCE of holonomies = -pi(cos2eta_i-cos2eta_j),
     reproducing the ledger L2.1 flux form (via cos2eta=2cos^2eta-1) as a transport holonomy -- so L5's posited flux
     is now DERIVED from the connection.
 (2) THE CONNECTION IS NON-INTEGRABLE (real curvature). Parallel-transporting around a CLOSED rectangle in the
     (phi,eta) shell family -- phi-loop at eta1, up to eta2, back-loop, down to eta1 -- returns a NET phase -pi (not
     0). A non-zero closed-loop holonomy is the signature of genuine curvature: the connection cannot be gauged away,
     the flux is a geometric invariant of the nested-shell family, not a coordinate choice.
 (3) FLUX IS INTRINSICALLY A NESTING (CROSS-SHELL) QUANTITY -- L7 form of L5's fact. Holonomy difference for a shell
     with ITSELF is exactly 0; only distinct nested shells carry flux. The connection makes precise WHY (ledger L2.1,
     project canon flux_needs_nesting): a single shell's loop holonomy is a pure gauge (removable), but the RELATIVE
     holonomy between nested shells is gauge-invariant.

DUAL RATCHET at L7: the connection (geometry -- how phase transports across nested tori) and the phase readout (the
L3 spinor phase) co-ratchet: the holonomy IS the accumulated transported phase. Sweeping the shell radius changes the
transport holonomy exactly as the Hopf-fiber phase winds -- geometry and phase are one object, now as a connection.

NEGATIVES / CONTROLS (each must FIRE):
  - ERASE-NESTING: collapse both shells to the same eta -> the closed loop degenerates and holonomy -> 0. No nesting,
    no curvature, no flux. (Structural erase, matching L5's erase-nesting control at the connection level.)
  - SELF-FLUX-ZERO: holonomy difference of a shell with itself is 0 -> flux is strictly cross-shell.
  - ANALYTIC-MATCH: the numerically transported holonomy matches the closed-form -2pi cos^2(eta) -- the transport is
    the real Berry connection, not an artifact of discretization.

HONEST SCOPE: earns L7 -- the shell connection, its parallel-transport holonomy deriving the L5 flux, and its non-
integrable curvature -- on top of L6. Does NOT build L8 (the global bundle / Chern-class quantization of the flux over
the full shell family) or above; next rung. Weyl chirality is the SIGN of this holonomy (a later object needing the
cut/orientation structure); this layer earns the holonomy magnitude and its cross-shell nature, not the chirality
assignment. No terrain/axis/engine claim rides on this. Hypothetical lane; owner doctrine under test.
