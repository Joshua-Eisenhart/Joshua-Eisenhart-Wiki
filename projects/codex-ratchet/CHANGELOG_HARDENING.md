# Hardening changelog — 2026-07-01 (external audit pass, claude.ai session)
All changes below are audit-inserted; sync knowingly. Sims' mathematical
content untouched except H-3 (path containment only).

H-1  ADDED    CLAUDE.md — agent contract (hard rules, withdrawn-claims list,
              honest-failure guards, V/W anti-conflation, open-decision fence).
H-2  FIXED    spec_and_reports/ORIENTATION.md had diverged from root
              ORIENTATION.md (two different orientations = agent trap).
              Replaced with a pointer stub; root is canonical.
H-3  FIXED    manifold_build_ladder.py wrote 4 JSONs into the caller's CWD.
              Now writes to sims_and_scripts/out/ (path containment only; no
              math change; verified identical stdout).
H-4  ADDED    run_all.py — deterministic harness: 20 sims, per-sim headline
              invariants with explicit tolerances, honest-failure guards
              (Axis-0 doctrine must stay False; 11/64 collapse must stay 11),
              withdrawn-claim guards ("no linear law" string asserted), JAX
              graceful skip, exit 0/1, writes run_all_report.json.
H-5  ADDED    requirements.txt (numpy/scipy/sympy required, jax optional,
              matplotlib deliberately excluded).
H-6  EDITED   spec §7g: inline AUDIT FLAG on the two-64s tension marked
              PENDING OWNER DECISION (guards against silent harmonization).
H-7  ADDED    spec_and_reports/PURE_MATH_CORE.md — the de-jargoned P1–P11
              proposition ledger from the audit session (referenced by
              CLAUDE.md as the fast label-free entry point).

H-8  ADOPTED  spec v29 (adds §7v, the χ₂ open-path instrument) from the other
              thread's lineage; re-applied H-6 (the two-64s flag, absent in
              that lineage).
H-9  EDITED   spec §7v: AUDIT FLAG with the fourth audit's grade correction —
              (i) V-vs-V* is the K-mirror pair, not the a2 pair (χ₂ responds
              to all three pairs; not charge-specific); (ii) the terrain-level
              decisive test fails (2/8 / 6/8, ε-contaminated phases). §7m
              remains admissible-candidate.
H-10 ADDED    sims_and_scripts/chi2_decisive_test_sim.py — instrument +
              charge-specificity tests + the §7m decisive test, deterministic.
H-11 ADDED    run_all.py entry for H-10 (guards the 2/8 / 6/8 result and the
              non-specificity finding against silent "fixes").
H-12 EDITED   CLAUDE.md: §7m status guard and χ₂ overclaim guard added to the
              withdrawn/hardened-claims list; open-items list updated to the
              sharpened form (ε-even a2-specific functional).

# Fourth pass — 2026-07-01 (this thread: fable-v2 merge + §7w resolution)
Base = fable's v2 zip (H-8..H-12: adopts §7v, adds the fourth-audit grade
correction and chi2_decisive_test_sim.py). This pass merged that base with the
other thread's §7v instrument and then RESOLVED the sharpened open item.
Version-label correction (per reviewer): the earlier M-1 note in the prior
bundle mislabelled the merge as spec v28->v29 / rosetta v11->v12; the saved
artifacts were spec v30 / rosetta v13. This pass produces spec (fable-v2 base
+ §7w) and rosetta with a fourth audit-log entry.

MP-1 RESTORED  chi2_openpath_readout_sim.py + chi2_openpath_readout.png (the §7v
               instrument; fable's v2 kept only the decisive-test sim). Added a
               correction header: property D is demonstrated on the K-mirror
               pair (V vs V*), not the a2 pair; math unchanged.
MP-2 ADDED     spec §7w — the terrain-level a2 item RESOLVED as a layer
               statement (no-go with a located home): eps-symmetrization is
               achievable but the eps-even functional reads a1 not a2; a2 is
               exact at the operator layer (||W.Ti.W-Te||=9e-16) and does not
               descend to terrain generators (residual ~2.05).
MP-3 ADDED     sims_and_scripts/eps_even_a2_specificity_sim.py (the no-go,
               deterministic) + eps_even_a2_specificity.png.
MP-4 EDITED    spec §7n bridge-status reconciled: chi2 = earned sector meter,
               not a2-specific; parity reads end-to-end at the operator layer.
MP-5 EDITED    PURE_MATH_CORE P10 -> earned-as-sector-meter + a2 layer no-go;
               rosetta row + open queue updated; CLAUDE.md fence: terrain-a2
               and charge-specific-chi2 items moved from "open construction" to
               "resolved no-go (§7w)"; P9 admissibility named as the open item.
MP-6 ADDED     run_all.py guards for the instrument sim and the eps-even no-go.
MP-7 ADDED     rosetta _audit_log_2026-07-01_fourth (fourth audit + §7w).
Honest-failure and withdrawn-claim guards from H-4/H-11 all still hold.


# Unified bundle — 2026-07-01 (reference docs added)
UB-1 ADDED  reference_docs/ — key source material from the repos, so the bundle
            is self-contained for a fresh thread with no repo access:
            - engine_math/ (engine-math-reference, igt-pattern-explicit-math,
              TERRAIN_LAW_LEDGER, QIT four-operator signed math, 64-schedule atlas)
            - science_method/ (recursive-science-methodology, leviathan-science-
              method-qit-engine-crosswalk, leviathan-v3.2 raw source) — the
              bidirectional engine<->science-process mapping; deductive=inductive
              reversed = the spec's UEUE/EUEU loop (§7l) / N01 order-sensitivity.
            - holodeck/ (doctrine, projective memory model, QIT-FEP-Leviathan
              integration, prediction-first processing) — the perception/memory lane.
            reference_docs/README.md maps each file to the spec sections it sources.
            These are SOURCE/SUPPORT tier (candidate/witness per their own front-
            matter), not audited spec claims.
UB-2 EDITED ORIENTATION.md LAYOUT section: added reference_docs/ + the hardening
            infra files (CLAUDE.md, run_all.py, requirements.txt, CHANGELOG).
Harness unchanged: 21 pass / 0 fail / 2 skip (jax) -> GREEN.

H-13 FIXED    run_all.py signed-zero brittleness: chi2_openpath check expected
              "closed=+0.0000" but numpy builds differ on signed zero of
              -arg(); check is now value-based (|closed| <= 1e-9).
H-14 ADDED    engines/ lane: oracle_targets.py (numpy contract ->
              targets.json), jax_engine.py, torch_engine.py, julia_engine.jl,
              validate_engines.py, README_LAPTOP.md. Verified here: oracle +
              JAX + torch agree to 1e-6 on all 16 stages (three independent
              numerical routes). Julia authored, first run pending on laptop.
H-15 FINDING  (P12) 16/16 N01 order sensitivity is load-bearing on the
              coherent axis: with H0 on the z-axis the four Fe stages commute
              EXACTLY with their terrains (phase covariance) -> 12/16. The
              bundle contained two axis conventions across sims; they are not
              interchangeable. Guarded by axis_loadbearing_n01_sim.py (H-16).
H-16 ADDED    sims_and_scripts/axis_loadbearing_n01_sim.py + run_all entry.
H-17 EDITED   CLAUDE.md: engines lane in the map; P12 axis rule added.
H-18 NOTE     torch installs with a transient "Bus error" message in this
              sandbox but imports and runs correctly (2.12.1); harmless.


# Upgrade pass — 2026-07-01 (O1 derived + laptop package + engines in harness)
UP-1 DERIVED  O1 (was the top open item): "exactly 2 native operators per terrain"
              is now DERIVED from C2, not labelled. admissibility_two_operator_sim.py.
              Same-basis (D,H) pairs commute exactly (order-gap 0) -> C2 forbids;
              2 cross-basis survivors are Axis-2 (W) conjugates; terrain frame sign
              selects one. Added to run_all.py SUITE (23rd sim). PASS.
UP-2 WIRED    engines/ cross-substrate lane into run_all.py: run_engines_lane() runs
              the numpy RK4 oracle, any importable substrate engine (jax/torch), then
              validate_engines.py; asserts GREEN. Verified PASS with jax present
              (oracle vs jax agree), SKIP when no substrate engine importable.
UP-3 ADDED    LAPTOP_RUN.sh -- one-command setup+verify for a local laptop: makes a
              .venv, installs numpy/scipy/sympy (+ jax/torch unless --fast), runs the
              full harness incl. engines lane, and runs the Julia route if julia is on
              PATH. Exit 0 = GREEN. Added LAPTOP_README.md.
UP-4 EDITED   CLAUDE.md: P9/O1 marked CLOSED; fixed a stale "≈2.05" residual to the
              real per-pair values 2.112 / 1.990. MODEL_LAYER_LEDGER 5.6 -> passes (hypothetical lane).
Harness now: 23 pass / 0 fail / N skip -> GREEN (engines lane PASS when jax/torch present).


# O3 done — 3-qubit contract (2026-07-01)
UP-5 SCALED   O3 (was open): the 16-stage engine contract lifted to 3 qubits (C^8).
              engines/oracle_targets_3q.py (numpy RK4), jax_engine_3q.py (exact 64x64
              superoperator expm), validate_engines_3q.py. Readout = 63-dim Pauli-
              expectation vector. GENUINELY 3q: ZZ chain coupling makes evolution
              non-factorizing (max negativity 0.038>0); 16 stages distinct (min pairwise
              0.174); 8/8 fusion + 16/16 order gaps preserved. Oracle vs JAX agree ~1e-12
              on all 16 stages in 63-dim space. Wired into run_all engines lane
              (reports "1q GREEN; 3q GREEN"). Julia/torch 3q engines: next (schema mirrors
              the 1q ones).
UP-6 NORMALIZED  wiki layout: all 25 sims consolidated under sims_and_scripts/, engines/
              lane pushed (was absent on wiki), 20 flat root duplicates removed. Public
              repo now mirrors the zip layout.


# Full-usage pass — 2026-07-01 (3 substrates verified in-house + info-processing)
UP-7 VERIFIED  PyTorch run IN-HOUSE for the first time (torch 2.12.1, CPU, complex128):
               both 1q and 3q torch engines execute here and validate against the numpy
               oracle. No "Bus error" -> D2 was fable's environment, not the code. Three
               independent routes now confirmed at BOTH scales: numpy RK4 oracle, JAX exact
               expm, PyTorch matrix_exp. 3q agreement ~1e-12 across all 16 stages (63-dim
               Pauli). Julia remains the 4th route (laptop-only; no runtime in sandbox).
UP-8 ADDED     torch_engine_3q.py (3q PyTorch route). validate_engines_3q now GREEN on jax+torch.
UP-9 NEW SIM   info_processing_sim.py -- DOES the engine process information? Each stage as a
               CPTP channel on a message qubit entangled with a reference. Result: all 16 are
               open-system processors (I_coh<0); entropy injection spans 0.006..0.991 bits
               (distinct info work); the Choi matrix separates all 16 (min 0.277); scalar
               entropy metrics collapse 5 Weyl-mirror pairs (two-sector signature at the info
               layer). figures/info_processing.png. Added to harness (now 25 pass).


# Memory layer — 2026-07-01 (spinor + holodeck precursor)
UP-10 NEW SIM  memory_sim.py -- does the engine STORE/RECALL? Three mechanisms:
               (1) memory cells: only projective-Si terrains t3/t7 retain a written z-bit
               (margin 0.71/0.53 after 8 holds); dissipative/depolarizing erase to ~0.
               (2) spinor phase memory: 360deg->sign -1, 720deg->+1, invisible at rho level.
               (3) memory<->computation tradeoff: bit margin 0.00 (tau=1) -> 0.43 (tau=0.02);
               compute hard=forget, compute gently=remember. figures/memory.png. Added to
               harness (26 pass). Model ledger Layer 12; O6 holodeck now PARTIAL (precursor built).


# Learning layer — 2026-07-01 (holodeck prediction-first / active inference)
UP-11 NEW SIM  holodeck_sim.py -- prediction-first active-inference loop in PURE QIT (free
               energy = Umegaki relative entropy, no classical math). (1) prediction loop
               minimizes F 2.62->0 monotone; (2) stationary learning cuts surprise 99%
               (belief stored in Hill projective cell); (3) single-cell capacity boundary:
               learns k=1, fails k>=2 (~0.4 bits residual); (4) 3-qubit register learns
               k=2,3,4 to <0.05 bits -> independent derived reason for the 3-qubit floor.
               figures/holodeck.png. Added to harness (27 pass). Layer 13; O6 now MOSTLY DONE.


# Leviathan bridge — 2026-07-01 (world-engine output interface, stub)
UP-12 NEW SIM  lev_bridge_sim.py + QIT_LEV_BRIDGE_SPEC.md -- the engine as a signal source a
               Leviathan graph consumes. Defines the per-tick stream contract {belief_bloch,
               surprise_bits, fe_gradient} and the LevBridge adapter (.tick/.subscribe). Proven:
               surprise is near-zero on a stable world, spikes 1.50 on a regime shift, decays as
               the engine relearns -- a usable control signal for Lev attention/action. Pure QIT.
               Deliberately NOT coupled to live Lev internals yet (foundations-up). Added to
               harness (28 pass). Layer 14; O6 bridge stub done, live wiring + action edge ahead.


# Action half / closed loop — 2026-07-01 (running world-engine)
UP-13 NEW SIM  agent_loop_sim.py -- the CLOSED active-inference loop. Adds the ACTION half:
               pick the action minimizing EXPECTED free energy G = risk - epistemic_value
               (pure QIT). Perception+action closed: from a world opposite the goal (goal_dist
               1.37) the agent drives it to preference (goal_dist <0.01, world_z +0.85) and holds
               it -- it ACTS to make the world match its model. figures/agent_loop.png. Added to
               harness (29 pass). Layer 13.5. Reverse edge Layer 14 deferred, done engine-side.


# Julia substrate live in-house — 2026-07-02 (4th route; a real finding)
UP-14 VERIFIED Installed the Julia 1.10.5 runtime IN THE SANDBOX and ran julia_engine.jl +
               julia_engine_3q.jl (the 4th independent route, the user's aligned choice).
               FINDING (CLAUDE.md rule 1): first run DISAGREED with the oracle (1q min-dist
               0.096) -- Julia is column-major, so reshape(transpose(rho),4) mismatched numpy's
               column-stacking vec. Fixed to reshape(rho,4)/reshape(v,2,2). After the fix all
               four substrates agree: 1q min-dist 0.0276, 3q worst pvec dev 9.89e-13 on C^8.
               Made the Julia engines DEPENDENCY-FREE (hand-rolled JSON, no registry / no ] add).
               Wired both into run_all engines lane (reports "...+julia GREEN" when julia is on
               PATH). Julia runtime archived as an artifact so it survives workspace sweeps.


# Formal proof lane — 2026-07-02 (laws FORCED, not fitted; aligned tools installed)
UP-15 TOOLS    Read the 3-engine dependency contract and installed the aligned Python-lane
               tools it names: z3-solver + cvc5 (SMT proof pair), qutip (QIT library), plus
               quimb/cotengra/diffrax/optax/sympy/mpmath. Julia package registry remains
               blocked by sandbox TLS interception (pkg.julialang.org connects but the
               re-signed cert is unparseable by Julia's downloader) -> Julia engine stays
               dependency-free (LinearAlgebra); the strict-carrier Julia packages are a
               laptop-side TODO.
UP-16 NEW SIM  axis_laws_dual_proof.py -- the axis laws are FORCED (SMT), proven in Z3 AND
               cvc5 with agreement, WITH an erased control that flips the verdict (drop the Ni
               constraint -> XOR uniqueness breaks). Proves: (1) Axis-0=Axis-1 XOR Axis-2 is the
               UNIQUE boolean law and IS xor; (2) b6=-b0*b3 uniquely bilinear, no linear law
               fits. Satisfies the contract's "z3 & cvc5 agree with erased controls that flip".
UP-17 NEW SIM  terrain_qutip_crosscheck.py -- QuTiP (standard Lindblad) reproduces the hand-
               rolled terrain superoperators to 2.2e-16 across all 8 terrains, confirms all 8
               CPTP (Choi PSD) and the nonunitality bits. 5th independent route at operator level.
               Both sims self-skip if tools absent (portable). Layer 15; harness 30 pass (constraintcore).


# Proof lane extended — 2026-07-02 (three more manifold laws forced)
UP-18 NEW SIM  manifold_laws_smt_proof.py -- (1) 8-of-16 access law FORCED by the sheet law
               (Z3: any non-8/8 split UNSAT); (2) pole-mirror pairing (0,4)(2,6) forced by
               zero-sum AND cross-sheet -- with the logged FINDING that zero-sum ALONE is
               degenerate (2 matchings zero-sum; near-equal |fixed_z|); (3) two-sector theorem
               as a SYMBOLIC IDENTITY (sympy): eigs(rho(theta,phi))={p,1-p} for all angles,
               dS/dtheta=0 exactly -> entropy identically blind to Axis-2. Self-skips if
               z3/sympy absent. Layer 15.7-15.9; harness 31 pass (constraintcore).


# Physics bridges — 2026-07-02 (established physics on the info<->physics seam)
UP-19 NEW SIM  physics_bridge_sim.py -- the engine reproduces two pieces of confirmed physics
               (NOT a ToE validation). (1) Landauer: dissipative terrains erase a bit; pure
               limit saturates the bound (S:1->0, purity->1, bath >= kT ln2 = 2.87e-21 J@300K);
               coherent drive only makes erasure partial. (2) Einselection: Ti z-dephasing
               selects {|0>,|1>}, Te selects {|+>,|->}; pointer states ARE the purity-1 channel
               fixed points -- "an attractor basin that selects for itself" as decoherence
               physics. figures/physics_bridge.png. Self-skips if qutip absent. Layer 16.


# Fluctuation theorems — 2026-07-02 (nonequilibrium generalization of the Szilard bound)
UP-20 NEW SIM  fluctuation_theorem_sim.py -- the engine's unitary drive obeys Jarzynski
               (<e^-bW>=e^-bdF, 3e-14 at every drive speed) AND Crooks (P_F/P_R=e^{b(W-dF)}
               across all work bins). 2nd law <W>>=dF holds; dissipated work drops as drive
               slows. Genuine dF=-0.793 (nontrivial). FINDING: first Crooks pass failed at the
               tails -- a reverse-protocol bug, not physics; fixed time-reversed drive recovered
               the exact law. numpy-only. Layer 16.3; harness 33 pass (constraintcore).


# Quantum speed limit — 2026-07-02 (the model's two axioms as a physical bound)
UP-21 NEW SIM  quantum_speed_limit_sim.py -- the engine's drive obeys the QSL, tying FINITUDE
               and NONCOMMUTATION to dynamics. (1) t_orth=(pi/2)/dE saturates the Levitin-
               Toffoli bound (ratio 0.999) at every energy; larger dE = faster. (2) [H,rho]!=0
               <=> dE>0 <=> evolution (three equivalent); commuting H never moves; full
               orthogonality needs the state balanced across eigenstates (tilted H precesses
               part-way). numpy-only. Layer 16.4; harness 34 pass (constraintcore).


# Holographic bound + decoherence scaling — 2026-07-02 (finitude & the classical boundary)
UP-22 NEW SIM  holographic_bound_sim.py -- FINITUDE as the holographic/Bekenstein bound:
               S(rho)<=log2(dim) (maximally-mixed saturates); Page-curve area law S(A)<=
               min(|A|,|B|) on n=6 qubits (smaller boundary caps shared info). numpy-only. L16.5.
UP-23 NEW SIM  decoherence_scaling_sim.py -- HOW FAST einselection wins: GHZ decoherence rate
               ~2n (independent baths, linear) / ~2n^2 (collective, superdecoherence, exact).
               The quantum->classical boundary is a scaling law. numpy+scipy. L16.6.
               Harness 36 pass (constraintcore).


# Chemistry bridge — 2026-07-02 (Layer 17.1, the bridge ladder begins)
UP-24 NEW SIM  chemistry_bridge_sim.py -- the chemical bond from the axioms via the Hubbard
               dimer. Fermionic {c,c^dag}=delta (Pauli exclusion) exact; ground state a spin
               singlet (S^2=0) with E=(U-sqrt(U^2+16t^2))/2; bond IS entanglement (S(site1)
               2b->1b); covalent->ionic crossover (docc 0.25->0). numpy-only. Layer 17.1.

# Holevo bound — 2026-07-02 (Layer 16.8, finitude of readout)
UP-26 NEW SIM  holevo_bound_sim.py -- accessible classical info capped: I(X:Y)<=chi<=log2(d).
               chi 0->1 bit as signals go identical->orthogonal; true upper bound (best
               measurement never beats chi); 4 tetrahedral symbols in a qubit still cap at 1
               bit. Caught+fixed a Bloch-normalization slip (unphysical chi>1) with a purity
               assertion. numpy-only. Layer 16.8. Harness 42 pass (constraintcore, full).


# Data-processing inequality — 2026-07-02 (Layer 16.9, the co-ratchet arrow)

# Bridge loopback -> terrain enrichment — 2026-07-02 (Layer 17.2, engine-deepening)
UP-29 NEW SIM  terrain_information_signature_sim.py -- the Layer-16 bridges loop back onto the
               real 8 terrain GKSL channels. Bridge observables (||L(I)||, entropy-prod rate,
               coherence-kill rate, Holevo chi) sort terrains into 3 max-differentiated classes
               damp<depol<proj; classification FORCED by z3 AND cvc5 (both SAT law, both UNSAT
               erased control -- three-engine contract). FINDING: density-level observables
               separate the 3 KINDS not all 8 terrains (eps/pole signs = documented density
               blindness; 8-way needs spinor level). numpy+scipy+z3+cvc5. Layer 17.2.
               Harness 45 pass (constraintcore, full).


# Terrain-signature SMT correction — 2026-07-02 (audit fix)
FIX  terrain_information_signature_sim.py -- replaced the pinned-constant SMT (bind measured
     rates to z3.RealVal, compare inequalities = dressed-up float compare) with a GENUINE
     combinatorial forcing check: solver searches c:8->{0,1,2} (3^8), full law UNSAT to any
     second partition (partition unique/forced), erased control SAT to an alternative. z3+cvc5
     agree. Verdict now depends on a real search, not a pre-computed comparison. Harness 45 pass.

H-19 VERIFIED full harness GREEN in a second clean sandbox: 40 pass / 0 fail /
              5 dep-conditional skips; then z3-solver+cvc5+qutip installed and
              all 5 conditional sims PASS (45/45 total). 1q AND 3q engines
              cross-substrate GREEN (numpy oracle vs jax+torch).
H-20 ADDED    REPO_AUDIT_AND_RESOLUTIONS.md into the bundle (source-level
              resolutions from the public Codex-Ratchet audit).
H-21 EDITED   MODEL_LAYER_LEDGER 6.6: two-64s tension RESOLVED BY SOURCE
              (atlas 9-10 three-layer split, 16 starred macro-stages); pending
              transcription only. Addendum: terrain-level a2 RESOLVED BY
              SOURCE as an installed frame flag (TERRAIN_LAW_LEDGER 17-22);
              the "find the invariant" open item closes as ill-posed.
H-22 EDITED   PHYSICS_INFO_BRIDGE_INDEX.md: attribution AUDIT FLAG — the ten
              bridges are theorems of the installed U-1 carrier; they earn
              realization faithfulness, not axiom grounding. CLAUDE.md guard
              added.
H-23 FIXED    engines/trajectory_result.json had no producer in the bundle;
              quarantined to engines/quarantine/ with note (results must ship
              with their generators). lev_bridge_stream.json producer exists
              (lev_bridge_sim.py) — false alarm on that one.
H-24 EDITED   requirements.txt: z3-solver, cvc5, qutip declared as the

# 8-way terrain separation — 2026-07-02 (Layer 17.3, resolves 17.2 finding)
UP-30 NEW SIM  terrain_8way_separation_sim.py -- resolves the 17.2 finding. Two dynamical readers
               (steady-<sz> einselection pointer + coherence phase-velocity = -sign(eps)) added to
               the coherence-kill KIND coordinate SEPARATE all 8 terrains. z3 AND cvc5 search the
               28 pairs for a collision: full set UNSAT (separated), drop either reader -> SAT
               (each necessary). Uses the a2 source-resolution (REPO_AUDIT 1b: a2 = installed
               frame flag, read through dissipation). numpy+scipy+z3+cvc5. Layer 17.3. 46 pass.


# Co-ratchet + 7-axis orthogonality lattice — 2026-07-02 (Layer 17.4, deepen the ratchet)
UP-31 NEW SIM  coratchet_axis_orthogonality_sim.py -- (A) entropy CONSTRAINED to each terrain:
               native pointer-coherence monotone->0 under own Axis-5 T-op (einselection), foreign
               T plateaus, foreign F pumps up. (B) 2 signed ops on axes 5,6: T dS=+0.16, F dS=0
               exact; b6=-(b0*b3). (C) 7-axis lattice: 5 primitive DOF free (2^5=32), 2 derived
               (b0=b1*b2, b6=-(b0*b3)) forced -- z3 AND cvc5 UNSAT negation / SAT after erase.
               Loops einselection(16.2)+DPI(16.9) back in. numpy+scipy+z3+cvc5. Layer 17.4. 47 pass.


# Co-ratchet lattice SMT completion — 2026-07-02 (audit fix)
FIX  coratchet_axis_orthogonality_sim.py -- added cvc5_erased_frees(): the erase-frees (SAT)
     control was z3-only; now BOTH z3 and cvc5 verify BOTH halves (forced=UNSAT, erased=SAT),
     satisfying the three-engine contract's requirement that both solvers agree on the flipping
     control. Harness still 47 pass.


# Coupled co-ratchet (dual-loop 720) — 2026-07-02 (Layer 17.5, deepen the ratchet)
UP-32 NEW SIM  coupled_coratchet_dualloop_sim.py -- entropy ratchet + operator ratchet as ONE
               720deg double-loop (DUAL_LOOP_SPINOR_GRAMMAR, a documented runtime gap). COOL=amp
               damping->pure pointer (non-unital, S->0), HEAT=rotate+dephase (S->1). (A) opposite
               fixed points. (B) chirality asymmetry: LEFT-RIGHT flux sign-consistent across 200
               probes (mean +0.31). (C) orderings noncommute (0.22); z3 AND cvc5 model-count the
               chirality words: alternating->2, else 16 (count flips). numpy+scipy+z3+cvc5. 48 pass.


# Biochemistry bridge — 2026-07-02 (Layer 18.1, bridge ladder rung 4)
UP-33 NEW SIM  biochem_bridge_sim.py -- two-state biomolecular switch as a qubit; coherent
               tunneling L<->R = noncommutative (no classical shadow). (A) T=0 tunneling exact vs
               analytic. (B) quantum rate floor vs classical Kramers ->0; Arrhenius recovered.
               (C) catalysis = dual-loop coherent channel (>2x, endpoints fixed). (D) z3+cvc5:
               transfer requires the noncommuting tunneling term (SAT with, UNSAT without, both
               solvers both halves). Improves on the owner's classical Kramers baseline. 49 pass.


# Evolution / chirality bridge — 2026-07-02 (Layer 19.1, bridge ladder rung 5)
UP-34 NEW SIM  evolution_chirality_bridge_sim.py -- two chiral operating spaces (left/right Weyl
               engine families) as runnable math per the owner's build note. (A) both run the same
               8-stage finite loop, drive to opposite poles (emergent). (B) mirror non-equivalence
               (M.X_L.M=X_R but X_L!=X_R, no sign-flag collapse). (C) F01+N01 forcing gate: z3+cvc5
               self-mirror AND noncommuting UNSAT (chirality forced), drop N01 SAT only for null.
               (D) Frank autocatalysis: tiny bias -> homochirality. HONEST: does NOT derive WHICH
               chirality is physical (weak-force parity is empirical input). 50 pass.


# Root axiom + entropic monism + S-knots — 2026-07-02 (Layer 0.1, the foundation)
UP-35 NEW SIM  root_axiom_sim.py -- renders the owner's root derivation chain as runnable math.
               (A) EC-1/EC-2 probe-relative identity (~ classes change with P). (B) EC-3 root gate
               a=a iff a~b: z3+cvc5 SAT with distinction / UNSAT when erased (both halves). (C)
               entropic monism: S = log2(distinguishable branches). (D) identity needs the A|B cut
               (I(A:B): product 0, Bell 2). (E) S-knot: Hopf fiber Gauss linking invariant 1 vs 0.
               Also fixed Layer 19.1 selection-map source citation (A2_CHIRALITY only). 51 pass.


# THE MODEL CORE — 2026-07-02 (Layer 0.0, distinguishability-creation engine)
UP-36 NEW SIM  distinguishability_engine_core_sim.py -- engages the owner's INTEGRATED model as ONE
               object (not isolated keyword-demos). Primitive = constraint on distinguishability;
               entropy is a LATER measure. a=a iff a~b made dynamical on the Hopf carrier: (A) fiber
               density-stationary (3e-16) vs base density-traversing (0.932); (B) Berry holonomy =
               -pi(1-|cos2eta|) matches doc exactly (inner -0.920, Clifford -pi); (C) distinguish-
               ability 0.932 with entropy 3e-16 -> entropy is downstream, not the substance; (D)
               z3+cvc5 fiber-UNSAT/base-SAT gate. CORRECTION: root_axiom_sim.py de-primitivized
               entropy (was "entropy IS the one substance" -> "entropy is a later measure OF
               distinguishability"), per OWNER_THESIS_AND_COSMOLOGY.md. 52 pass.


# AXIS-0 GRAVITY MODEL — 2026-07-02 (Layer 0.2, gravity = entanglement-entropy gradient)
UP-37 NEW SIM  entropic_gravity_axis0_sim.py -- renders the owner's axis-0 gravity model (ENTROPIC_
               MONISM_ORIGIN_AND_COSMOLOGY sec 5-8 + seeding Grok chat) as checkable math. Einstein-
               form field eq sourced by grad of entanglement entropy: (1) negentropy well sources
               (grad S)^2=518.6, flat field 1.6e-29 (gravity needs a gradient); (2) two-regime sign
               structure (attractive well / repulsive hill, equal mag = one force); (3) z3+cvc5
               flat-UNSAT/gradient-SAT gate. Fenced as OWNER DOCTRINE under test per doc sec 7 (does
               not derive the field eq, not >1D GR, does not replace GR/QM). Built after reading the
               owner-supplied gravity docs, not presumed. 53 pass.


# GATE SOUNDNESS FIX — 2026-07-02 (audit response)
UP-38 FIX  distinguishability_engine_core_sim.py + entropic_gravity_axis0_sim.py: the z3/cvc5 gates
           previously hardcoded the branch boolean (pinned-constant if-check). Rewritten so solver
           inputs are DERIVED from the sims' own measured numbers (fib_drift/base_travel; source/
           source_flat), the structural law is tested for FIT against the measured data, and a
           counterfactual control flips UNSAT(with law)->SAT(law dropped) so the law -- not
           arithmetic -- carries the verdict. Ledger v34/v35 (D)/(3) wording corrected. 53 pass.


# CITATION CLOSURE (STATE_OF_THE_MODEL open-ledger V.1) — 2026-07-02
UP-39 CONFIRM  Open item V.1 ("igt-pattern lines 470-478 verbatim (wiki) — the one uncited sentence
               behind §7t's 'conjugated = x↔z image' source reading") is resolvable and now confirmed.
               VERIFIED: the wiki doc concepts/igt-pattern-explicit-math-reference.md contains the
               four-operator table verbatim at lines 475-478 (Ti z-dephasing / Te x-dephasing / Fi
               x-rotation / Fe z-rotation; native terrains Se,Ne direct vs Ni,Si conjugated) and the
               §7k tribunal sentence at line 166. The spec (CONSTRAINT_CORE_FORMAL_SPEC §7q/§7t) already
               cites these lines and upgrades the "conjugated = x↔z image of direct" reading to the exact
               W-covariance theorem (W·Ti·W=Te residual 3.4e-33). So the source is not merely cited but
               earned; the STATE doc's ledger simply lagged the spec. No new sim needed. 53 pass.
               NOTE ON PLAN: STATE_OF_THE_MODEL §VI orders Consolidate->Contact->Extend and warns
               "extension before contact is the failure mode the whole harness exists to prevent."
               A new coherent-information / i-scalar sim is a Phase-E action and is therefore HELD until
               the Phase-X contact items (V.1-V.4) are addressed. This turn does the cheapest Phase-X
               action (V.1 verbatim confirmation), per that ordering.


# PHASE-X V.2 — 2026-07-02 (charge-specific chi2 via dissipation foothold: NEGATIVE)
UP-40 NEW SIM (negative result)  eps_even_a2_dissipation_foothold_sim.py builds the instrument V.2
               proposed -- read the installed frame through dissipation -- and resolves it NEGATIVELY.
               Three honest findings: (1) the eps-even readout separates a2 but CIRCULARLY (a2 is the
               installed frame, fed in); (2) the 0.22-vs-0 dissipation gate FAILS (unitary dynamics
               also moves the eigenvector under the frame); (3) NOT a2-specific (any nontrivial frame
               fires). So a2 is an installed-frame flag / operator-layer W-covariance label, not a
               terrain-generator charge. STATE open-ledger V.2 -> RESOLVED NEGATIVE. Failure is signal:
               the decisive 7m test is not decidable by this instrument; a real a2-specific meter stays
               open. Held to Phase-X ordering (no Extend). 54 pass.


# LAYER 0.3 — 2026-07-02 (signed Axis-0 primitive; loops back into gravity 0.2)
UP-41 NEW LAYER  signed_axis0_primitive_sim.py builds the SIGNED Axis-0 primitive as its own
               foundational object: coherent information I_c(A>B)=S(rho_B)-S(rho_AB)=-S(A|B), sourced
               from ENTROPIC_MONISM sec 8 ("-S(A|B) kernel | Conditional entropy IS the entanglement
               measure") + the entropy-tables doc (signed primitive; mutual info the unsigned
               companion). FOUR results: (1) sign of I_c separates binding(+)/dispersing(-) where the
               unsigned I(A:B)>=0 cannot; (2) STRUCTURAL THEOREM -- 4000 separable states max I_c=-6e-6
               (positive I_c is a genuine, and STRICTER, entanglement witness: Werner entangled from
               p=1/3 but binds only from p*=0.7476); (3) LOOP-BACK -- the 0.2 gravity two-regime split
               is now the two MEASURED signs of I_c along a spatial chain (binding core attractive /
               dispersing halo), replacing the hand-placed +/-S_anom stand-in; (4) z3+cvc5 gate,
               derived inputs, law fits + flipped control. This RENDERS (hypothetical lane) the sign structure 0.2 asserted.
               Honest scope unchanged: entropic-gravity MECHANISM under test, not a GR derivation. 55 pass.


# LAYER 0.4 — 2026-07-02 (entropic foundation reproduces Newtonian gravity; dark-sector fenced)
UP-42 NEW LAYER  entropic_newton_limit_sim.py answers the owner framing ("new foundations to GR that
               lead to the SAME observations and account for what GR+visible-matter can't"). On the
               0.2/0.3 gravity=entropy-gradient substrate, in Verlinde entropic-force form: (1) EXACT
               Newtonian limit -- a=2pi c kT/hbar with holographic N=A c^3/(G hbar), kT=2Mc^2/N
               reproduces a=GM/r^2 to ratio 1.000000 across Earth/Sun/galaxy (Earth g=9.7275 falls
               out); (2) STRUCTURAL -- N∝r^p gives a∝r^(p-3): AREA p=2 -> slope -2 (Newton), VOLUME
               p=3 -> slope -3 (wrong); holographic area-scaling FORCES inverse-square; (3) FENCED
               dark-sector -- entropy-gradient 1/r term (log potential, the kind 0.3's signed I_c
               source gives for an isothermal profile) flattens rotation curves without particulate
               dark matter, BUT a0 is phenomenological NOT derived from RC-1+RC-2. Honest scope:
               (1)+(2) reproduce established entropic-gravity (Verlinde) on the substrate -- not novel
               physics; (3) owner doctrine under test (sec-7 fence). No claim to replace GR/SM. 56 pass.


# LAYER 20.1 — 2026-07-02 (Standard-Model bridge: weak force left-handedness from F01+N01)
UP-43 NEW LAYER  weak_force_chirality_bridge_sim.py ADMITS (hypothetical lane) one SM structural fact -- the weak interaction
               couples ONLY to left-handed fields (maximal parity violation) -- from the SAME F01+N01
               move Layer 19.1 used for biological chirality, on the left-Weyl substrate. Source:

               only left-handed particles h=-1/2"; "Type 2 (Right) = antimatter") + axes-math sec 9
               (Axis-3 selects Weyl rep; SU(2)/Hopf orbits). Chiral projectors P_L=1/2(1-g5). RESULTS:
               (1) P_L vertex asymmetry A=1 (maximal, V-A) vs vector I control A=0 (parity conserved,
               EM-like); (2) F01+N01 forces chirality -- P_L is finite + parity-noncommuting
               (g0 P_L g0 = P_R), and the ONLY parity-symmetric combination 1/2(P_L+P_R)=I/2 is exactly
               the parity-blind vector coupling; so any finite parity-noncommuting coupling must be
               chiral (side=LEFT is empirical, as in 19.1); (3) z3+cvc5 gate, derived inputs, law
               "finite AND parity-noncommuting => chiral" fits + flipped control. HONEST SCOPE:
               reproduces the weak PARITY structure and its shared F01+N01 origin with 19.1/A2; does
               NOT derive SU(2)xU(1), the Weinberg angle, or couplings. Owner doctrine under test;
               no claim to replace the SM. 57 pass.


# LAYERS 0.5 + 0.6 — 2026-07-02 (deep foundations: division-algebra ratchet + cosmogenesis persistence)
UP-44 NEW LAYER 0.5  division_algebra_ratchet_sim.py -- the ratchet from WEAKEST structures / SHORTEST
               leaps with nonassociativity ratcheted, as the Cayley-Dickson ladder R->C->H->O->(S kill).

               Verified: commutativity dies at H, associativity at O (order/grouping faces of N01);

# LAYER 0.7 — 2026-07-02 (loop-back / convergence: one basin, many perspectives)
UP-46 NEW LAYER 0.7  perspective_convergence_sim.py -- tests the owner reframe that the ratchet, QIT
               engines, and physics model are ONE attractor basin seen from different perspectives, not a
               divergent set. Takes ONE Werner state family and computes each already-built physics
               bridge by its OWN native recipe: gravity (0.4) = sign of signed I_c; chirality (19.1/20.1)
               = forced iff entangled (negativity>0); cosmogenesis (0.6) = expansion size S(rho_A).
               RESULTS: (1) all three are projections of the single parameter p -- one object, many
               views. (2) NESTED onset order: entanglement onsets at p=1/3, binding-sign at p*=0.7476 --
               entanglement is necessary but NOT sufficient for the gravitational binding sign (a strict
               entangled-but-nonbinding regime exists between). (3) LOOP-BACK LESSON: the master invariant
               governing the physical sign is the SIGNED I_c (Layer 0.3), strictly stronger than raw
               entanglement -- the convergence RANKS the invariants and tightens which quantity is
               foundational. (4) z3+cvc5 gate: law chain bind<=>I_c, I_c=>ent, forced<=>ent fits all three
               regimes; control "entangled-but-nonbinding forced to bind" UNSAT-with-law -> SAT-without.
               HONEST SCOPE: demonstrates the one-basin claim as computed convergence on a one-parameter
               family + extracts the invariant-ranking lesson; does NOT prove global basin uniqueness.

               finite spinor network, nodes=octonionic spinors, edges=noncommutative+nonassociative
               couplings, built ON Layer 0.5. Closes loop-back packet item 3 ("exhibit a G2 action, not
               just dim 14"). RESULTS: (1) path-bracketing gap ~1.6 across a 3-edge path = grouping-level
               N01 as a NETWORK-level observable; (2) single-edge control gap = 0 (nonassoc invisible on a
               point -> network necessary); (3) G2 ACTION exhibited: concrete phi=exp(0.3 D) with
               phi(xy)=phi(x)phi(y) to ~1e-16 (real Aut(O) element), bracketing gap INVARIANT under it ->
               G2 is the symmetry group of the network coupling schedule; (4) L/R chirality gap ~0.05 on
               the network (ties to 19.1/20.1). Hypothetical lane; does NOT yet run terrain/operator

# LAYER 0.9 — QIT FREE ENERGY PRINCIPLE RENDERED THROUGH THE RATCHET (hypothetical lane) — 2026-07-03
UP-49 NEW LAYER 0.9  qit_fep_ratchet_sim.py -- a pure-QIT FEP DERIVED FROM the constraint surface stage by
               stage, NO shortcuts, with EVERY classical/thermal primitive of standard FEP replaced by its
               constraint-surface origin (owner directive: "the real math must always come before the
               jargon"; "thermo sounds like a dangerous term"). Rejected the doc's own thermal prior
               exp(-E/T)/Z (Boltzmann) and the amplitude-damping "ground state"; replaced by GKSL fixed
               points of the native Axis-5 T-operators (Ti z-dephasing, Te x-dephasing), full-rank by
               construction so relative entropy is finite with ZERO regularization -- no temperature, no
               energy, no -log p, no classical probability anywhere in the math.
               REPLACEMENTS: p(z)->density spectrum (F01); exp(-E/T)->GKSL fixed point; -log p(x)->S(rho||sigma);
               Bayesian update->CPTP relaxation; Markov-blanket graph->vanishing I(A:C|B).
               SIX RENDERED STAGES (hypothetical lane): (1) F01 distinguishability FORCES the functional -- S(rho||sigma) unique as
               BOTH CPTP-monotone AND additive (relent additive 3.6e-14; trace distance NOT, off 0.287).
               (2) Axis-0 geometry splits surprise EXACTLY (Pythagorean |d|=0) into classical spectral
               (entropy DOF) + quantum basis-mismatch (coherence DOF). (3) Axis-5 operators ARE inference:
               each native T-op drives surprise vs OWN pointer monotone to 0 (self-evidencing); foreign
               >0.1. (4) 3-qubit Markov blanket = vanishing I(A:C|B) (chain 0.0000; direct A-C 0.278).
               (5) active selection = min-surprise (z->Ti, x->Te). (6) z3 AND cvc5: law fits, foreign-forced
               control UNSAT->SAT. LOOP-BACK: FEP is a different VIEW of the ratchet, not a new mechanism.

# LAYER 0.10 — ACTIVE HALF OF QIT-FEP: POLICY SELECTION ON THE MANIFOLD — 2026-07-03
UP-50 NEW LAYER 0.10  qit_active_inference_planning_sim.py -- the ACTIVE half of the QIT Free Energy
               Principle (0.9 built perceptual), run as a PLANNING loop over operator PATHS. A policy is a
               sequence of native operators (Ti/Te dephasings + F rotations); cost = PATH INTEGRAL of
               surprise G(pi)=sum_t S(rho_t||goal); active inference = select min-cost policy. All CPTP +
               relative entropy; NO reward, NO temperature, NO classical probability (goal = density-op
               prior, cost = distinguishability). RESULTS: (1) PRAGMATIC: min-path-integral policy reaches
               a tilted-pointer goal (rotate-then-commit), final surprise 0.06 from 0.16. (2) N01 INHERITED:
               100/125 3-step policies cost != reverse (mean gap 0.21, max 0.87); selected fwd 0.31 vs rev
               0.84 -- policy space carries the manifold's noncommutation, the SAME path-dependence as the
               0.8 octonion-network bracketing gap. (3) EPISTEMIC (resolve which-concept, soft posterior
               q(c)~exp(-S(rho||prior_c))): committing/dephasing policy resolves concept-identity (+0.013
               bits), rotating does not (0.000) -- directional sign structure, magnitude honestly small
               (nearby anchors). (4) GATE z3 AND cvc5: law "valid policy <=> reaches AND order-consistent"
               fits, control "non-reaching forced valid" UNSAT-with-law->SAT-without. LOOP-BACK: closes the
               FEP loop -- perception (0.9) relaxes surprise, action (0.10) selects the path that will; both
               the SAME relative-entropy descent over trajectories; 0.8's N01 makes planning nontrivial.

# LAYER 0.11 — 16-STAGE ENGINE SCHEDULE AS ACTIVE-INFERENCE POLICY SPACE — 2026-07-03
UP-51 NEW LAYER 0.11  sixteen_stage_engine_schedule_sim.py -- ties Layers 0.8/0.9/0.10 to the REAL geometric
               constraint manifold: the 8 terrains (earned all-distinct 17.3, eps-signed coherent drive +
               kind dissipator) as the state space, each admitting EXACTLY 2 of 4 native operators (one T,
               one F) on its Axis-2 sheet (eps>0 direct {Ti,Fi}; eps<0 conjugated {Te,Fe}) = 8x2 = 16
               distinct engine stages (owner: "16 unique stages ... each terrain has only 2 kinds of
               operators it can use, in a certain signed axis6 way"). RESULTS: (1) 16/16 stages DISTINCT as
               information transforms (fingerprint on 5-probe set, min pairwise 0.336) -- no DOF collapse.
               (2) SHEET-ADMISSIBILITY is the UNIQUE partition (z3+cvc5 SEARCH not pin): sheet bit forced to
               measured eps -> 1 model; eps-erased -> 2^8=256 ambiguous. (3) ACTIVE PLANNER (0.10 machinery)
               on the REAL 16-stage schedule: min-cost 2-stage policy REACHES terrain-4 pointer (surprise
               2.77->0.93); 240/256 policies order-sensitive (max gap 1.27) = N01 inherited from manifold.
               LOOP-BACK: terrains (geometry) + 2-op admissibility (Axis-5/6 signed rule) + active planner
               (0.10) are ONE engine -- the manifold with the FEP loop running on it. HONEST NEGATIVE:
               surprise-reduction as SOLE admissibility criterion is NOT clean (4/8 single-probe) and is NOT
               claimed; admissibility here is the structural Axis-2 sheet rule, SMT-gated. Hypothetical lane;

               trace-distance alternative (one comparison, not a uniqueness theorem)"; added INSTRUMENT
               SCOPE block -- relent is a free-energy ANALOGUE (divergence, not variational FE); self-

               regime means 0.04/0.30/0.93) -- magnitude-separable; CONDITIONING (Lüders, the independent
               build's class) emits spiky surprise (index ~0.15, within-std 0.90) -- NOT magnitude-separable
               but CUSUM catches BOTH shifts (@100+13, @200+5). The two instruments need DIFFERENT detectors.
               z3 AND cvc5: "magnitude-separable <=> high index" fits, forced-separable control flips.

# SUBSTRATE DECISION + LAYER 0.13 (quantum Hopfield, torch trainable lane) — 2026-07-03
UP-54 SUBSTRATE SPLIT (measured, owner-endorsed)  Benchmarked all four carriers on the SAME 16-stage GKSL
               contract: numpy 0.49s (oracle/audit), JAX jit+vmap 0.18s (~2.8x, standing workhorse for
               sweeps), torch 1.72s but the ONLY substrate with autograd THROUGH the tick loop (dS/dk
               computed by backprop -- trainable perception, differentiable EFE planning, gradient energy
               descent), julia = strongest fully-independent leg / canon arbiter. Decision (owner-endorsed):
               julia canon arbiter everywhere; jax+julia standing pair; torch load-bearing wherever LEARNING
               is the claim; all four when a result gets stamped. "Forward pass = possibilities, backward
               pass = constraints -- torch is the ratchet's native architecture."
UP-55 NEW LAYER 0.13  quantum_hopfield_memory_sim.py -- a quantum associative memory (Hopfield-class) EARNED
               from the terrain attractor structure, not presumed (fresh-LLM spec forbids Hopfield-as-
               primitive unless a lower layer forces it; here the lower layers are terrain-as-basin 4.x/17.3
               + the norm-preserving spinor carrier 0.6). The energy SURFACE is the memory: stored patterns
               = pure states that are the attractor fixed points of E(psi)=-sum_k|<p_k|psi>|^4; recall =
               gradient descent of E on the spinor carrier (torch autograd -- the trainable substrate).
               Results: (1) content-addressable recall probe fidelity 0.58 -> 1.0, energy -0.37 -> -1.01;
               (2) 3-QUBIT FLOOR measured (owner's "need at least 3 qubits"): 4-pattern recall 0.25/0.25/1.00

               numpy-oracle cross-check agrees on the recalled attractor; (5) z3 AND cvc5 gate on the recall
               law + flipped control. HARNESS: new TORCH LANE added -- run_all.py gains torch_python()
               portable interpreter discovery (current -> $CR_TORCH_PYTHON -> sibling conda env importing

# LAYER 0.14 — spinor memory — 2026-07-03
UP-56 NEW LAYER 0.14  spinor_memory_sim.py -- the two 1-bit memory registers that live in the spinor psi and
               are INVISIBLE to the density rho (scaffold 104/153: "the density quotient kills global spinor
               phase, lifted path, 720deg return, holonomy"). (A) 720-DEGREE LOOP-PARITY bit: U(t)=exp(-i t/2
               n.sigma) gives spinor sign +1/-1/+1 at t=0/2pi/4pi (two 360deg loops, deductive + inductive, over the SAME geometry closing at 720deg; the deductive-loop + inductive-loop
               the two directions of one manifold traversal closing at 720deg), carried in psi, density distance identically 0 at every stage.
               (B) SHEET-GATED RETENTION bit: a z-encoded bit under the direct sheet's z-dephasing survives
               (fidelity 1.0 for 300 ticks); under the conjugated sheet's x-dephasing it decays to 0.0 (>100x
               ratio) -- independently reproduces the owner's local dual-engine measurement (direct 1.0,
               conjugated 0.146). (C) z3 AND cvc5 gate: the parity bit is spinor-only (spinor_reads XOR
               density_reads), forced-density-readable control flips. Loop-back: this is why the Axis-0 sims
               had to re-base at spinor level; the spinor memory is the psi-only register (loop-parity +
               sheet-history) that the associative memory (0.13, density pointer = which pattern) runs
               alongside -- two registers, one carrier. FULL HARNESS VERIFIED: 67 pass / 0 fail / 0 skip

               reconstruction (two_weyl_engines_sim, removed) that wrongly assumed each engine uses only 2
               operators. CORRECT structure: engine split is by FLUX/Hamiltonian sign; each engine uses all

# LOOP-BACK PACKET #3 CORRECTIONS — 2026-07-03
UP-60 REPAIR  Applied WEB_THREAD_LOOPBACK_3 corrections (referee panel + stamp-inflation sweep):
   Hopfield (1a-1d): dropped the "~0.14N Hopfield limit" analogy -- the quartic |<p|psi>|^4 is DENSE
     associative memory (Krotov-Hopfield/Demircigil), capacity~dim, NOT classical Hebbian 0.14N; labeled the
     patterns Haar-random/best-case with correlated/adversarial untested; reframed the n=1,2 floor as a
     measured CONSEQUENCE of the dimension law (not a discovery); labeled E(psi) explicitly as ATTRACTOR
     ENERGY (Lyapunov landscape), NOT a Hamiltonian (preempts physical-dynamics misread).
   qit_active_inference_planning (3): "planning INHERITS noncommutation" -> order-sensitivity from generic
     noncommuting stage maps (the property N01 names), a shared property not a derived inheritance.
   qit_fep_ratchet (3): "forced (stage 1)"/"one earned stage" -> distinguishing-test-with-flip-control
     wording; "quantum Markov chain" -> CLASSICAL-CMI scope (diagonal states), consistent with the 0.9 note.
   Ledger stamp sweep (2,3): 0.11 "Scope: earns" -> "Scope: measures ... each with a flip/erase control,
     hypothetical lane"; 0.10 "N01 INHERITED" -> "ORDER-SENSITIVE (from generic noncommuting maps)";
     signed_axis0 0.3 -- added Gaussian core/halo DEMONSTRATION-only status (was in code, missing from
     ledger); weak_force 20.1 -- "earned parity structure"/"FORCED" -> "admits ... hypothetical lane" /

# MANIFOLD SPINE RATCHET — L1 — 2026-07-03
UP-61 NEW SPINE L1  manifold_L1_probe_quotient_sim.py -- process reset after owner flagged saliency-skipping
               ("work the whole foundations of the manifold from constraints. with dual ratchet... no
               saliency skipping"). Terrains/axes/engine stood on the carrier directly; the spine under them
               was never ratcheted. L1 = the probe-quotient floor S/~_M built from L0 roots (F01/N01/probe-
               identity), quotient COMPUTED not asserted, with the dual ratchet (quotient refines + entropy
               readout recomputes per admitted probe), per-rung ladder 1q/2q/3q, full negative roster firing,
               and a dual-solver identity gate (probe-identical->different-class UNSAT with law, SAT erased).
               First rung of the spine; L2-L15 to follow in contract order, none skipped. Terrains/axes/engine

               partial-trace marginals Tr_{A\B} + marginal-compatibility law, nesting on L1. Dual ratchet:
               rank stratum + marginal entropy co-move as the global state entangles (product->Bell, marginal
               rank 1->2, S 0->1 bit, negativity 0->0.5). Negatives #1 (product-neg-zero), #2 (perturbed-
               marginal-fails), #10 (per-rung 3q) fire. Dual-solver Schmidt/marginal-compatibility gate:

               spine. FULL HARNESS VERIFIED: 71 pass / 0 fail / 0 skip GREEN.

UP-63 NEW SPINE L3  manifold_L3_spinor_hopf_sim.py -- spinor/phase/projective surface CP^{2^n-1} + Hopf
               skeleton S^1->S^3->S^2 + relative-phase torus T^{n-1}, nesting on L2. The phase L1/L2 are blind
               to (Hopf fiber = the divided-out global phase). Dual ratchet: phase is a new admitted dof
               (projective point moves, density readout fixed). Negatives #8 (fiber load-bearing via 2pi sign)
               and #4 (X resolves relative phase) fire. Dual-solver gate: spinor sign is fiber-exclusive
               (UNSAT with law, SAT erased). Third rung; makes the old Axis-0 spinor-level finding a spine

               factor + marginal purity co-move (product->Bell, factor dissolves as purity 1->0.5, neg
               0->0.5). Negatives #1 (product-neg-zero), #9 (factorization diverges entangled/separable), #10
               (per-rung 3q GHZ) fire. Dual-solver gate: Weyl factorization needs product (UNSAT for

UP-65 AXIS AUTHORITY  Adopted axes-full-layout-relations-anti-conflation-2026-07-03.md (owner-supplied,
               sources f53880681/34d817e34/95df90d4d) into reference_docs as the authoritative axis layout.
               CORRECTIONS: (1) Axis-3 = fiber(inner)/lifted-base(outer) loop class, NOT flux; flux is geometry
               banned as axis content. (2) Type1/Type2 is a NON-REDUCTION -- NOT flux alone AND NOT A3xA4
               alone (loop-placement law: A3xA4xA5xA6 = 8 paired sigs not 16; same (A3,A4) in both types);
               type = combined chart vector (sheet/chirality/H-sign + IN/OUT + A3 loop-class + A4 order). My
               earlier "Type1/2 = A3 AND A4" over-reduction superseded. (3) axes are readout maps A_i:M(C)->V_i,
               never primitive coords; verified all four spine sims (L1/L2/L3/L4) grepped for axis content -- each carries only
               "No terrain/axis/engine claim rides on this", geometry-only, matches global lock. Recorded a4-b3 coupling prediction + a1-a5 conflation trap as engine-layer
               acceptance tests. Doc travels in every future bundle. Harness unaffected (docs only).

UP-66 JP PACKET     Processed jp_complete_packet_20260703 (JP mesh node). (1) Two-builder Type-1 convergence
               CONFIRMED: my independent type1_engine_igt chart matches JP's node 8/8 on (terrain,operator,

UP-67 RATCHET RUNS  ratchet_climb_engine_v0.py: the ratchet as an ACTUAL climbing process (the wheel, not just
               the pawl). Decidable: level strength = expressible distinction (partition refinement, weakness
               order MEASURED); lift trigger = Lost() by exhaustive enumeration (Minimalist failure = proof);
               smallest-step = weakest level resolving >=1 lost demand, stronger logged REJECTED_UNFORCED.
               Climbs L0->L1_Z->L2_Pauli->L3_Spinor as THREE forced teeth (each a distinct measured lost
               distinction: <Z>, <X>, spinor-lift for rho-identical R(2pi)); T1-T4 pass; T5 basin = 4 permuted
               orders converge identical. Corrects a node build that batch-jumped L0->L3 and whose fix was
               broken Python. Full harness 74 pass/0 fail/0 skip GREEN (verified). scratch_diagnostic.

UP-68 FAIR N01 DRIVE  axis0_drive_fair_n01_test_sim.py: answers the node's fifth-test loop-back (does live
               Axis-0 power the climb?). Move-matched dead twin tuned (brentq) to identical order-INVARIANT
               signature -> indistinguishable from rolling under every order-invariant readout (reproduces the
               "no drive" finding), separated ONLY by the order-sensitive N01 commutator readout (rolling 0.0399
               vs dead* 0.0, dead zero = measured commutation). ANSWER: rolling wins for real but N01-CONDITIONALLY
               -- the drive lives in N01, no free-standing scalar advantage. Connects to node tier L6 6.2 (N01
               axis-conditioned). Adopted node corrections/. Full harness 75 pass/0 fail/0 skip GREEN. scratch.

UP-69 AXIS0 FROM SPEC  axis0_shell_polarity_docfaithful_sim.py: Axis-0 built FROM the owner's doc (AXIS0_PHYSICS
               _MODEL_CORE sec 24/37/38) not at it. A0_raw as a 7-vector; shell weighted-compositor never argmax;
               Phi0 projection DISCOVERED. One neutral knob -> two faces self-emerge, predict held-out at 0.917;
               scalar_entropy_only kills to 0.615 (load-bearing); one_future_control to 0.719 (many-futures real);
               scrambled_Omega 0.479. HONEST REMAINDER: commuting_path_family 0.938 + no_inward_outward 0.875 did
               NOT flip; logZ & order_gap do not separate at this baseline. Full harness 76 pass/0/0 GREEN. scratch.

UP-70 RATCHET AT FOUNDATIONS  foundational_ratchet_entropy_gradient_sim.py: Axis-0 rebuilt as the entropy-gradient
               DRIVE at the very foundations (owner correction: it kept failing because built as a late readout;
               it IS an entropy gradient). F01+N01 -> norm-preserving carrier -> growing possibility space opens a
               permanent distinguishability gap = the drive -> MSS climb. CO-RATCHET geometry==entropy one-for-one.
               FEYNMAN freeze -> gradient flat, climb halts. Also banked: polarity classifier rebuilt per-component
               (no-algebra; honest finding Axis-0 NOT load-bearing beyond entropy at baseline); removed a fake
               dual-solver tautology gate from the ratchet sim. Full harness 78 pass/0/0 GREEN. scratch.

UP-71 DISTINGUISHABILITY-FOUNDED RATCHET  foundational_ratchet_entropy_gradient_sim.py rebuilt: the drive measure
               is now QUANTUM DISTINGUISHABILITY (trace distance / Helstrom), NOT bits/log2/microstate-counting
               (owner: "bits are classical"). Two faces: available (perfect-instrument, opening/positive) minus
               resolved (acquired-bases, binding/negative) = Axis-0 gap. Grows->climbs (gap open, 6 teeth);
               Feynman freeze->halts (gap flat); residual gap = real quantum limit not a counting artifact. Fixed
               a duplicate stale polarity harness entry. Full harness 78 pass/0/0 GREEN. scratch.

UP-72 RATCHET FOLLOWS ITS OWN RULES  foundational_ratchet_entropy_gradient_sim.py rebuilt so the PROCESS runs, not
               its vocabulary (owner: "actually follow my ratchets rules... understand mss as part of the
               constraints. jumping to bits and vectors shows the process not being done"). DEMAND = distinguishable-
               but-unresolved pair (trace distance). MSS = admissibility CONSTRAINT (admit only forced structure);
               PAWL proven (every non-climb = candidates rejected-unforced). Co-ratchet one-for-one. Gate tests the
               RULES not a climb count. Honest remainder: dim-2 carrier saturates after 2 teeth (gap widens but no
               new demand) -> the F01 3-qubit-floor. Full harness 78 pass/0/0 GREEN. scratch.

UP-72b GATE CORRECTION (auditor)  foundational_ratchet: removed the hand-picked live_climbs>=N threshold entirely
               (first tightened 3, then loosened 1 -- both were picked counts). Verdict is now CONSERVATION only:
               climb IFF a forced admissible step is available (derived by replaying the demand structure), plus
               the structural rules; non-vacuity guaranteed by axis0_early (False if no demand ever opens), not by
               any count. live_climbs is read out (2), never required. Full harness 78 pass/0/0 GREEN.

UP-72c GATE CORRECTION 2 (auditor)  foundational_ratchet: removed the last picked threshold -- axis0_early no
               longer requires the first demand at shell r<=1. "Axis-0 acts as soon as it exists" is now stated
               without an index: the FIRST demand-bearing shell (wherever it falls) must climb it. Every remaining
               comparison in the gate is structural (>=1 some / ==0 none / >1e-9 nonzero), none a picked pass-count.
               THETA/RESOLVE_FRAC define what a DEMAND is (physics), not the verdict. Full harness 78 pass/0/0 GREEN.

UP-73 OBJECTIVE VALIDITY TARGET  engine_reidentification_objective_sim.py -- external, model-blind judge for the
               16 engine stages, from the owner's criterion "identity is the survivor of probe rotation" (a=a iff
               a~b operational). Fingerprint each stage on a SEEN probe family, re-identify from a NEVER-SEEN one
               via a probe-set-independent channel signature. Gate = the CONTROL FLIP only (shuffled -> chance);
               re-id rate reported as-is, NOT gated to a ceiling. Result: 11/16 re-identify, separation 0.620 over
               chance; the 5 misses are the depol eps-degenerate pairs (t1/t5) + the Fe proj-commuting pair
               (t3/t7) the oracle predicts. Full harness 79 pass/0/0 GREEN. scratch.

UP-74 EXTERNAL DYNAMICS-ID ARBITER  installed PySINDy 2.1.0 (+ derivative) into constraintcore; engine_dynamics_id
               _arbiter_sim.py hands per-tick Bloch trajectories of the 8 terrain GKSL flows to PySINDy (off-the-
               shelf, zero QIT-theory input) to discover governing ODEs. Held-out R^2 via model.score (no forward-
               integration). TEETH: shuffled-time control detonates (R^2 ~ -1e9) on every terrain. Gate = control
               flip only, R^2 reported as-is. Result: 7/8 terrains fit at R^2 0.93-1.00; t3 (proj+eps=+1) is
               unfittable by degree-2 poly (fast projective collapse -> no held-out derivative signal), an honest
               external finding. Scope: 8 continuous terrains only (16 operator stages -> UP-73). Full harness
               80 pass/0/0 GREEN. scratch.

UP-75 OBJECT-FORMATION SCORECARD  engine_object_formation_scorecard_sim.py composes the two external validity
               targets (re-identification convergence + PySINDy handling) into an adapted Lev formation-loss
               surface. Applies the Lev mesh-package discipline: PURE INSTRUMENTS emit measurements only
               (convergence_loss 5*(1-rate) verbatim; handling_loss an engine-domain proxy max(0,1-R^2)), a
               SEPARATE policy eval decides on both negative controls flipping (dynamics-lane Controls section,
               NOT policy requiredControls). Loss reported not gated -- the structural fix for the UP-72b/72c
               gate-tuning cascade. Result: conv_loss 1.562, handling_loss 0.143, both controls flip. Full harness
               81 pass/0/0 GREEN. scratch.

UP-76 COSMOGENESIS AS THE RATCHET'S FIRST TOOTH  cosmogenesis_ratchet_first_tooth_sim.py -- the universe's
               beginning as an INSTANCE of the root ratchet running (MSS in a static field), incorporating the
               2026-07-06 entropy-gradient-intrinsic shift. SAME demand/MSS rules at the origin: static field
               carries no difference (no time); MSS forces the weakest persistent carrier = norm-preserving spinor;
               its expansion is entangled (dark-energy-first, concurrence 0->1) and chiral (mirror = opposite sign,
               F01+N01 forced); the entropy gradient opens WITH the carrier and freeze halts it. Lev measurement/
               verdict discipline; all five controls flip. Three bugs fixed in the MATH not the gate (XX entangler,
               signed holonomy, product-state off-by-one). Grounded x_grok_chat_TOE.txt 30/38/47; already in
               toe_cosmology docs. Full harness 82 pass/0/0 GREEN. scratch.

UP-77 PAWL HARDENING (witness identity + append-only memory)  pawl_witness_identity_memory_sim.py -- the
               2026-07-04 sec.8/sec.10 correction as measurement. Minimality alone does not lock: MSS-alone pawl
               accepts 12 lateral swaps among equal-cost witnesses; witness-identity + append-only-memory pawl
               accepts 0. Memoryless-drive kill: memory drive climbs (9 teeth, gap 0.316), memory-erased drive
               random-walks and stalls (5 teeth, 0.059). Both controls flip. Full harness 84 GREEN. scratch.
UP-78 THE 3-QUBIT FLOOR  ratchet_three_qubit_floor_sim.py -- carries the conservation-gated ratchet past dim-2
               saturation. Acquired stock = 3n single-qubit Pauli-axis bases (tomographically complete only at 1
               qubit; full tomography needs 4^n-1 axes). 1 qubit saturates (0 teeth-before-sat, 0 open demands); 2
               and 3 qubits keep forcing (12 teeth, 69/161 open demands). Floor real for the mechanism reason, not
               a fit -- WHY >=3 qubits are needed. Full harness 84 GREEN. scratch.

UP-79 THE UNIFIED RATCHET  unified_ratchet_witness_memory_3q_sim.py -- composes the foundational demand/MSS/
               gradient mechanism + the witness-identity/append-only-memory pawl (UP-77) + the 3-qubit carrier
               (UP-78) into ONE climb. LIVE (3q): retained ladder 3, 7 acquired bases, 0 lateral swaps. Three
               controls flip: ladder-vs-flat (memory 3 vs memoryless 0), pawl-lock (witness 0 vs minimality-only
               39 lateral swaps), Feynman freeze (0 teeth after freeze). Locks by remembered witness, intrinsic-
               gradient driven, climbs past dim-2. Full harness 85 GREEN. scratch.

UP-80 THE BRIDGE TOOTH (carrier -> terrains)  bridge_tooth_carrier_to_terrains_sim.py -- the ratchet's next tooth
               after cosmogenesis, making the climb continuous from the bare chiral spinor carrier up to the 8
               terrain dissipators. Bare unitary carrier cannot close the attractor demand (td preserved 0.261); a
               terrain dissipator closes it (td 0.002). MSS next tooth = a GKSL dissipator with a fixed point = a
               terrain. 8 terrains pairwise-distinct CHANNELS (min 0.195; fixed points coincide, channels do not).
               Chirality carries forward (eps sheets opposite, product -1). Real terrain generators. Full harness
               86 GREEN. scratch.

UP-81 THE NEXT TOOTH (terrains -> engine stages)  next_tooth_terrains_to_engine_stages_sim.py -- the ratchet's next
               tooth after the terrains, continuing the climb up to the composed engine stages. A bare terrain
               cannot process order (terrain-alone order gap 0.00e+00); MSS next tooth = one native operator in two
               orders = an engine stage (mean order gap 0.185). 16 signatures pairwise-distinct (min 0.028).
               Chirality splits into Type1/Type2 (disjoint, each internally distinct). Real oracle generators.

UP-82 FOUNDATIONS RE-AUDIT (forced/robust/load-bearing)  foundations_reaudit_forcing_robustness_sim.py -- loop-back
               audit of whether the root is EARNED not merely sufficient. Lane 1: complex spinor FORCED (real dim-2

UP-83 SECOND ROOT AUDIT (drive + MSS tie-break)  foundations_reaudit_drive_and_mss_tiebreak_sim.py -- Lane A: the

               self-subtraction). Full harness 89 GREEN. scratch.

UP-84 THE NEXT TOOTH (stages -> 360 loop)  next_tooth_engine_stages_to_360_loop_sim.py -- single engine stages ->
               the composed 360-degree loop, read at the spinor level. A stage has no cyclic handedness (single-op
               loop UEUE==EUEU 0.00); MSS next tooth = a closed 4-beat 360 loop (deductive vs inductive psi
               distance 1.138). Parity spinor-level (psi 360=-1/720=+1, rho both +1 -- density blind to tense).
               Handedness (tense) orthogonal to chirality (invariant under eps flip). Honest correction: dropped a
               forced opposite-sign chirality claim for the true orthogonality result. Full harness 90 GREEN. scratch.

UP-85 THE 720 DOUBLE LOOP + SPINOR-LIFT AUDIT  next_tooth_720_double_loop_and_lift_audit_sim.py -- PART 1: the 720
               double loop closes what the 360 cannot (single 360 -> -psi overlap -1 does not close; 720 double =
               360-comp-360 -> +psi overlap +1 genuine return; tense halves distinct 1.138). PART 2 (loop-back root
               audit): the spinor lift is FORCED not installed (NO density observable separates R(2pi)|0> from |0>,
               max gap 2.2e-15 over 200 Hermitian obs, but psi gap 2.0; erased quotient kills the distinction
               2.0->0.0; lift minimal 2-to-1 cover). Same claim separately z3+cvc5 verified at L2->L3. Full harness
               91 GREEN. scratch.
