# CLAUDE.md — agent contract for the constraint-core bundle

You are working inside a formal research bundle with strict claim discipline.
Read this whole file before editing anything. It is short on purpose.

## What this is
A machine-checked formalization of a constraint-based theory (single-qubit GKSL
dynamics + a layered spec). Everything is `scratch_diagnostic`,
`promotion_allowed=false`. The ratchet earns canon; you do not.

## The one command that matters
```
python3 run_all.py
```
Must exit 0 (GREEN) **before and after** any change you make. It runs all 20
sims and asserts their headline invariants with tolerances. JAX sims are
skipped automatically if jax is absent; that is still GREEN.

## Hard rules (violating any of these is the failure mode this file exists to prevent)

1. **Never edit an expected value in `run_all.py` to make a check pass.** A
   mismatch between a sim and its expected value is a FINDING — report it, do
   not resolve it. Same for mismatches between the spec and a sim: divergence
   is data, not a bug to silently harmonize.
2. **Some expected results are honest failures. They must stay failed.**
   - `manifold_build_ladder.py`: `doctrine realized ... : False` — the Axis-0
     entropy doctrine does NOT hold at density level. Making it True is a
     regression, not a fix.
   - `engine_64_schedule_sim.py`: order-blind collapse `11/64` — the collapse
     is the point.
3. **Withdrawn claims — never restore these, even if older text in the corpus
   still asserts them:**
   - the "linear gauge-breaking law, R² = 1.0" (§7o — withdrawn; it was an
     affine identity of a one-step Kraus parametrization);
   - the "threefold convergence" of §7o/§7p/§7q (it is ONE bit — non-unitality
     `L(I) ≠ 0` — read three ways);
   - the flat "16/16 access theorem" of §7s (the earned form is two-tier:
     exact on the 8 dephasing stages, 14/16 under a chirality-neutral probe,
     16/16 only with the sheet Hamiltonian adopted into the loop definition);
   - "χ₂ is closed / Axis-0 reads end-to-end" (§7v — overclaim; χ₂ is earned
     only as a general eigenvector-sector meter. The "V vs V*" demonstration
     read the K-mirror pair, not the a2 pair; the terrain-level decisive test
     fails 2/8–6/8 with ε-contaminated phases. See the §7v audit flag.);
   - "Axis-0 = Axis-1 ⊕ Axis-2, exactly (earned)" (§7m — status is
     ADMISSIBLE CANDIDATE, not identity: the proven direction is parity ⇒
     single readouts fail; the converse has never been tested because the
     parity has never been read. Do not upgrade §7m's status until a
     charge-specific χ₂ passes the terrain-level test.);
   - "the §7q null supports fusion" (a null cannot; fusion is settled by the
     containment split + W-covariance §7t, not by the metric null).
4. **Sims are pure math. No labels in code.** Structural indices only
   (`eps, a1, a2, t0..t7, Ti/Te/Fi/Fe`). All naming — terrain names, Jungian
   labels, physics vocabulary ("gauge", "Weyl", "geometric phase") — lives in
   `data_json/rosetta_layer.json` with earned/witness/candidate tiers. Never
   move a label from the rosetta into a sim, and never change a label's tier.
5. **Do not conflate V and W (§7u).** `V = exp(−iH₀s)` is the continuous state
   gauge (commutes with the engine flow; carries the δ=0 degeneracy and
   K = H₀). `W = (σx+σz)/√2` is the discrete pair-duality (swaps Ti↔Te, Fi↔Fe
   exactly; does NOT commute with the flow). They are provably distinct; code
   or text that substitutes one for the other is wrong.
6. **Owner-level open decisions — do not resolve them yourself:**
   - the two-64s tension: §7g's `64 = 2×8×4` (all combos runnable) vs
     §7r's `16 = 8×2` native stages (which makes 64 = 16 stages × 4
     sub-stages, with 48 combos inadmissible). Incompatible counts; flagged
     in the spec; the owner decides.
   - the terrain-level direct/conjugated bit (a2 on terrains): RESOLVED as a
     layer statement (§7w). a2 is realized exactly at the OPERATOR layer (§7t,
     W-covariance) and provably does NOT descend to a terrain-generator
     observable: the ε-even quotient of χ₂ reads the a1 dynamics bit (finite
     check over the 8 generators), and W conjugates the operators but not the
     generators (residual ≈2.05). Do not re-open this as "find the terrain
     meter" — the no-go is the result. What remains genuinely open below.
   - the charge-specific χ₂ at the TERRAIN layer: a no-go (§7w). χ₂ stays an
     earned eigenvector-sector meter, not a2-specific — do not relabel it
     "closed as an a2 meter". §7m therefore reads end-to-end only at the
     operator layer; keep its terrain-layer status ADMISSIBLE CANDIDATE.
   - the P9 admissibility derivation: why exactly 2 operators per terrain
     (from C1–C3). Still open — a derivation, not a lookup.
7. **Comparisons are tolerance-based, never `==`** on floats. Claim grades per
   spec §8: promotable rows need `symbolic_identity` / `closed_form` /
   `finite_exhaustive` routes; float tolerance is `diagnostic_float_nonclaim`.
8. **Do not regenerate figures** unless explicitly asked; `figures/` is
   pre-rendered and matplotlib is deliberately not a requirement.
9. **Determinism:** all stochastic sims are seeded. If you add a sim, seed it
   (`np.random.default_rng(0)`), make it standalone, CWD-independent, print
   its headline invariants to stdout, and add a `run_all.py` entry.
10. **When editing the spec**, corrections are logged visibly (see §7o's
    correction note for the required style) — never silently rewritten. New
    claims get an explicit claim ceiling.

## Orientation for the math itself
Read, in order: `ORIENTATION.md` → `spec_and_reports/PURE_MATH_CORE.md`
(compact, label-free, P1–P11) → the spec sections you need. The pure core is
the fastest way to load the actual mathematics without absorbing overlay
vocabulary as if it were structure.
