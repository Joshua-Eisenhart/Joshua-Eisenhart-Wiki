# THE MODEL, LAYER BY LAYER — component-level status ledger
# 2026-07-01. Every layer of the constraint manifold + engines, with its real
# math, its earned/candidate/open grade, and the specific computed value.
# Status key:  EARNED = exact/symbolic or machine-precision verified
#              CANDIDATE = correct within stated scope; interpretation not closed
#              OPEN = not yet derived/built
# Build order the owner specified: axes run 6.5.3.4.1.2.0 (Axis-0 is the gate).

# LAYER 0 — FOUNDATIONS (the root axiom and the three base constraints)
################################################################################
0.1  Root axiom  a=a iff a~b        EARNED (symbolic). Identity is probe-relative:
     (distinguishability)           two objects are equal iff no probe distinguishes them.
0.2  C1 Finitude                    EARNED. Finite-dimensional throughout (no limits smuggled).
0.3  C2 Non-commutation             EARNED. [A,B]!=0 is load-bearing; the whole order-
                                    sensitivity (N01) rests on it. Commuting control -> gap ~2e-17.
0.4  C3 Emergent identity           EARNED. First object = finite non-commutative refinement
                                    category; identity emerges, not assumed.
     --> forces H = C^2, D(C^2), Pauli basis (machine-checked realization, 1e-16).

################################################################################
# LAYER 1 — THE CARRIER (Hilbert space + Hopf fibration)
################################################################################
1.1  H = C^2, density matrices      EARNED. rho = 1/2(I + r.sigma), the concrete carrier.
1.2  Hopf pi: S^3 -> S^2            EARNED. Fiber-blindness (global phase invisible) 1e-15.
1.3  Entropy coordinate             EARNED (exact). S(rho(eta)) peaks at the Clifford torus
                                    eta=pi/4, S = ln2. This is the Axis-0 entropy coordinate.

################################################################################
# LAYER 2 — GEOMETRY (nested Hopf tori + flux)  [flux REQUIRES nesting]
################################################################################
2.1  Nested Hopf tori T_eta         EARNED. Each shell carries Berry holonomy -2pi cos2eta.
2.2  Flux needs nesting             EARNED (this is a real structural fact, your claim confirmed).
                                    A SINGLE shell gives only holonomy; FLUX appears only ACROSS
                                    nested shells: Phi(eta_i,eta_j) = 2pi(cos2eta_i - cos2eta_j).
                                    Measured Phi(0,1)=3.46; total Chern 7.30, order-indifferent.
2.3  A=0 ablation                   EARNED. Flat carrier -> curvature vanishes -> holonomy 0.
                                    Confirms the geometry (not the code) carries the flux.

################################################################################
# LAYER 3 — WEYL SHEETS (the 2 independent engine types)  [your "L and R engines"]
################################################################################
3.1  Two Weyl chiralities           EARNED. rho_L: r'=+2 n x r ; rho_R: r'=-2 n x r
     (opposite Bloch handedness)    (1e-16). H_L = +H0, H_R = -H0. These are the TWO
                                    INDEPENDENT engine types — not two halves of one.
3.2  Engine type = global loop sign EARNED (dynamical). Left engine all +geometric-phase,
                                    Right all -. A person IS one chirality.
3.3  Eight-of-sixteen access        EARNED. Left accesses in-terrains t0-t3, Right t4-t7;
                                    each engine reaches exactly 8 of 16 stages. Forcing a stage
                                    onto the wrong sheet flips its geometric phase 8/8 — a
                                    person locked to one chirality genuinely cannot run the other 8.
3.4  The two 8-sets are pole-mirrors EARNED. t0/t4 z*=+/-1, t2/t6 z*=-/+1 (sum 0).

# LAYER 4 — THE 8 TERRAINS (each fully specified; MAX-differentiated)
################################################################################
# Each terrain = a GKSL generator pinned to its scratch fixed point. nonunital bit
# and fixed-point z are the oracle's verified values.
4.0  t0 Funnel  (Se-in)   EARNED. damp(sigma+), NON-UNITAL, fixed z=+0.713
4.1  t1 Vortex  (Ne-in)   EARNED. depolarizing, unital,   fixed z= 0.000
4.2  t2 Pit     (Ni-in)   EARNED. damp(sigma-), NON-UNITAL, fixed z=-0.707
4.3  t3 Hill    (Si-in)   EARNED. projective(sz), unital,  fixed z=+0.070

4.5  t5 Spiral  (Ne-out)  EARNED. depolarizing, unital,   fixed z= 0.000
4.6  t6 Source  (Ni-out)  EARNED. damp(sigma+), NON-UNITAL, fixed z=+0.711
4.7  t7 Citadel (Si-out)  EARNED. projective(sz), unital,  fixed z=+0.094
4.8  Max differentiation  EARNED. All 8 DISTINCT under a 14-feature fingerprint, mean
                          pairwise 5.5, MIN 0.35 (t3-t7, the projective-Si pair — nearly
                          sheet-symmetric; the real bottleneck, not a bug).
4.9  Non-unitality theorem EARNED (exact). The damping terrains t0,t2,t4,t6 have ||L(I)||=
                          sqrt2; the others 0. THIS is the physical surplus (see 5.4/6.3).

################################################################################
# LAYER 5 — THE 4 OPERATORS + the 2-native-per-terrain law
################################################################################
5.1  Ti (sigma_z dephasing)   EARNED. Dissipative, destroys Z-coherence. lambda~0.69.
5.2  Te (sigma_x dephasing)   EARNED. Dissipative, destroys X-coherence. lambda~0.73.
5.3  Fi (sigma_x rotation)    EARNED. Unitary R_x(theta), preserves purity.
     Fe (sigma_z rotation)    EARNED. Unitary R_z(phi), preserves purity.
5.4  Surface IS the operator  EARNED (your "geometry contains the operator"). Containment
     (operator-geometry fusion) residual: projective/depol terrains 0.00-0.12 (the surface
                              literally IS its operator algebra); source-locked 0.67 in EVERY
                              frame (irreducible geometry the operators can't express).
5.5  W-covariance (signed law) EARNED (exact). The Hadamard W=(sx+sz)/sqrt2 maps Ti<->Te and
                              Fi<->Fe EXACTLY (3.4e-33 / 4.5e-17). This is the "signed Axis-6"

# LAYER 6 — THE 16 STAGES and the 64 SCHEDULE (engines running, unique per stage)
################################################################################
6.1  16 stages                EARNED. 16 = 8 terrains x 2 native operators. ALL DISTINCT
                              (mean pairwise 4.6). Each is a genuinely different information op.
6.2  Unique processing = N01  EARNED. Order-blind readout collapses 64->11; the N01
                              (order-sensitive, terrain-first vs operator-first) readout gives
                              64/64 distinct. Uniqueness per stage IS the non-commutation.
                              Per-stage order gaps range 0.020 (t1:Ti) to 0.459 (t6:Te); all >0.
6.3  8-fused / 8-surplus split EARNED. Exactly 8 of 16 stages are operator-fused, 8 carry
                              source-locked surplus geometry = the non-unitality bit (4.9).
6.4  Load-bearing coherent axis EARNED (NEW, P12). The coherent axis (1,1,1)/sqrt3 is NOT a
                              convention: put H0 on sz and the 4 Fe stages COMMUTE with their
                              terrains (order gap 2e-16), collapsing 16/16 -> 12/16. Verified.
6.5  64 = 2 x 8 x 4            EARNED as one reading; but see OPEN:
6.6  Two-64s tension          *** OWNER DECISION (unresolved). *** 64 = 2 engines x 8 terrains
                              x 4 operators (all combos) VS 16 native stages x 4 sub-stages
                              (48 combos inadmissible). Incompatible counts. Only you decide.

################################################################################
# LAYER 7 — THE 7 AXES (the DOFs of the manifold; must NOT collapse)
################################################################################
7.1  Axis-1 (dynamics)        EARNED. dissipative {Se,Ni} | unitary {Ne,Si}. The ENTROPY
                              charge (eigenvalue sector). All 14 single readouts land here.
7.2  Axis-2 (frame)           EARNED. direct {Se,Ne} | conjugated {Ni,Si}. The PHASE charge
                              (eigenvector sector), invisible to entropy (symbolic identity:
                              unitary similarity preserves spectrum).
7.3  Axis-3/4/5/6             EARNED as structural DOFs (topology, tense/loop-order, operator
                              kernel family, signed handedness). Axis-6 sign law b6 = -b0*b3
                              verified 0/8 violations.
7.4  Axis-4 tense = loop order EARNED. Deductive = UEUE, Inductive = EUEU — the SAME four
     (bidirectional science)   substeps in REVERSED order. This is your "deductive science =
                              inductive reversed": it is the N01 order-reversal at the loop level.
                              A terrain in isolation has no tense; tense is a loop property.
7.5  Axis-0 (perceiving)      See LAYER 9 — the hard gate, resolved as a parity.
7.6  DOFs do not collapse     EARNED. The three topology partitions (Axis-0/1/2) are mutually
                              orthogonal; entropy is blind to the frame at 2e-15.

################################################################################
# LAYER 8 — THE CO-RATCHET (entropy and operators both run on the manifold)
################################################################################
8.1  Entropy IS a Hamiltonian EARNED. S(rho) = <K_rho> (modular/GNS). S(rho||sigma) =
                              <K_sigma - K_rho> >= 0; GNS inner product PSD; DPI monotone
                              (0.340 -> 0.235 under a channel). Entropy and operators co-ratchet.
8.2  Parity tied to co-ratchet EARNED. The frame bit becomes physically readable only once the
                              entropy (dissipative) sector is switched on — ties Axis-0's
                              readability to the co-ratchet (see 9.4).

################################################################################
# LAYER 9 — AXIS-0 (the hard gate every prior model stalled on)
################################################################################
9.1  Axis-0 = intuition|sensing EARNED (candidate interpretation). {Ne,Ni} perceive many
                              admissible futures; {Se,Si} perceive one actual present.
9.2  Axis-0 = Axis-1 XOR Axis-2 EARNED (exact vs repo operator table). Sensing {Se,Si} = where
                              dynamics & frame AGREE; intuition {Ne,Ni} = where they DISAGREE.
                              NOT linearly separable -> why all 14 single readouts failed.
9.3  Two-sector theorem       EARNED. Needs BOTH the entropy charge (Axis-1) and the phase
                              charge (Axis-2); a single scalar necessarily collapses to Axis-1.
9.4  Axis-0 is a LATE object  EARNED. Not terrain-local; it is downstream of the loop +
                              entropy-sector becoming active. This is WHY it is the gate.
9.5  Spinor 720deg tense       EARNED (exact). 360->-psi, 720->+psi (SU(2)); measurement decays
                              the lifted phase. The density-level tooling is BLIND to this —
                              which is why every prior density-level readout collapsed.
9.6  chi2 phase-sector meter   CANDIDATE (scoped). An open-path Bargmann phase reads the
                              eigenvector sector (earned) but is NOT a2-specific (reads a2/eps/K
                              alike). The a2 bit is earned at the OPERATOR layer (5.5, exact) and
                              provably does NOT descend to terrain generators (per-pair residuals
                              2.112 for t0->t2, t4->t6 and 1.990 for t1->t3, t5->t7; all ~2, >>0).
                              => Axis-0 parity reads end-to-end at the OPERATOR layer; carried,
                              not measured, at the terrain layer.
9.7  Per-terrain Ne/Ni+ vs      CANDIDATE. The intuition>sensing ordering holds at loop level
     Se/Si- entropy split       (0.731 > 0.706) but is not a clean terrain-local functional —
                              consistent with 9.4 (Axis-0 is late, not terrain-local).

################################################################################
10.1 numpy RK4 oracle          EARNED. The 16-stage contract (targets.json): min pairwise

10.2 JAX pure-functional kernel EARNED. Exact superoperator expm, vmap+jit, float64. AGREES
                              with the RK4 oracle to 1e-6 on all 16 stages -> a genuine
                              two-METHOD cross-check (integration vs matrix-exp). This is
                              "engines running on the aligned substrate", verified this pass.
10.3 PyTorch engine            EARNED, verified in-house 2026-07-01 (torch 2.12.1, CPU, complex128):
                              1q AND 3q torch engines run here and agree with the oracle (no
                              Bus error -- D2 was fable's environment, not the code).
10.4 Julia engine              EARNED, verified in-house 2026-07-02 (Julia 1.10.5). Installed

                              0.0276 (matches jax/torch); 3q worst pvec dev 9.89e-13 on C^8.
                              FINDING (CLAUDE.md rule 1): the first run DISAGREED (min-dist
                              0.096) -- Julia is column-major, so the original

                              vec. Fixed to reshape(rho,4)/reshape(v,2,2); disagreement resolved.
                              A real convention bug the 4th route caught before the laptop did.

# LAYER 11 — INFORMATION PROCESSING (does the engine actually RUN information?)
################################################################################
11.1 Each stage is a channel   EARNED. Every stage applied as a CPTP channel to a message
                              qubit maximally entangled with a reference. All 16 have
                              coherent information I_coh < 0 -> genuine open-system processors
                              (they exchange information with the environment, not toy unitaries).
11.2 Distinct information work  EARNED. Entropy injected S(channel|0>) spans 0.006 -> 0.991 bits
                              across the 16 stages -- a wide, structured range, not the same op
                              relabeled. (info_processing_sim.py; figures/info_processing.png)
11.3 Full-channel identity     EARNED. The Choi/process matrix separates ALL 16 stages
                              (min pairwise 0.277). Each stage is a distinct information processor.
11.4 Two-sector signature      EARNED (and consistent with Layer 7/9). Scalar entropy metrics
     shows up in information    COLLAPSE 5 Weyl-mirror pairs (e.g. t1:Ti==t5:Ti): entropy is
                              blind to the chirality/phase sector; only the full channel (Choi)
                              sees it. Same two-sector structure as Axis-0/Axis-2, now visible
                              at the information-processing layer.

# LAYER 12 — MEMORY & TRAJECTORIES (spinor + holodeck memory precursor)
################################################################################
12.1 Memory cells = projective-Si  EARNED. Write a classical z-bit, hold under a stage
                              channel, read back. ONLY the projective terrains t3/t7 (Hill,
                              Citadel = the "Si" cells) retain the bit (margin 0.71/0.53 after
                              8 holds); dissipative (damp) and depolarizing cells erase it to
                              ~0. The model's memory substrate is the projective sheet --
                              matches the projective-holodeck-memory model. memory_sim.py.
12.2 Spinor phase memory      EARNED (exact). 360deg loop -> spinor sign -1, 720deg -> +1;
                              the loop-parity bit lives in the spinor sign and is INVISIBLE at
                              the density level (rho identical at every point). A topologically
                              protected bit -- the spinor-memory mechanism, distinct from 12.1.
12.3 Memory<->computation      EARNED. Push two messages through a compute schedule then a
     tradeoff                  projective store, vary per-stage flow time tau. At full strength
                              (tau=1) the compute path thermalizes the message before the store
                              (bit margin ~0); as tau shrinks the state carries the bit through
                              and the store recovers it (margin 0.00 -> 0.43; monotone over tau<=0.25, a
                              negligible ~0.004 dip at tau=0.5). DESIGN
                              LAW: an engine that computes hard forgets; one that remembers must
                              compute gently. figures/memory.png.
12.4 Trajectory = running engine EARNED (mechanism). A schedule of stages run as a state-carrying
                              computation (not per-stage-in-isolation) is the world-engine
                              precursor: state written in, transformed by compute stages,
                              stabilized by a store stage, read back. The 64-schedule is the
                              full trajectory space; this is its memory-bearing use.

# LAYER 13 — LEARNING (holodeck prediction-first / active inference, pure QIT)
################################################################################
13.1 Free-energy prediction    EARNED. Belief meets observation; free energy F=S(obs||belief)
     loop                       (Umegaki quantum relative entropy, bits -- NO classical math)
                              is minimized by moving the belief toward the observation. F drops
                              monotonically 2.62 -> ~0. This is the perception half of FEP.
13.2 Learning (stationary)     EARNED. Belief stored between observations in the Hill projective
                              memory cell (Layer 12); repeated exposure to one environment cuts
                              surprise ~99% (0.426 -> 0.0035 bits). Genuine learning, not filtering.
13.3 Memory-capacity boundary  EARNED. A SINGLE cell learns a stationary (k=1) environment to
                              near-zero surprise but CANNOT learn a k>=2 cycling sequence
                              (residual ~0.4 bits). Quantified limitation, not a failure.
13.4 3-qubit register learns   EARNED. Using the extra qubits as a context/address register
     sequences                 (4 memory slots), the engine learns k=2,3,4 sequences to <0.05
                              bits. => an INDEPENDENT, DERIVED reason for the model's 3-qubit
                              floor: it upgrades the holodeck from single memory to SEQUENCE
                              memory. holodeck_sim.py; figures/holodeck.png.
13.5 Action (expected FE)      EARNED. The ACTION half of active inference: the engine picks
                              the action minimizing EXPECTED free energy G = risk - epistemic
                              value (risk = F(predicted_obs||preference); epistemic = expected
                              belief-entropy drop). CLOSED LOOP (perception+action): from a world
                              OPPOSITE the goal (goal_dist 1.37) the agent drives the world to its
                              preference (goal_dist <0.01, world_z +0.85) and holds it. The engine
                              ACTS to make the world match its model -- a running world-engine.
                              agent_loop_sim.py; figures/agent_loop.png. This is the reverse edge
                              the Layer-14 bridge deferred, done on the ENGINE side (pure QIT);
                              the live Lev wiring maps it onto a concrete world/action model.

14.1 Signal-stream contract    EARNED (stub). The engine exposes ONE thing to a Lev graph:
                              a per-tick record {belief_bloch, surprise_bits, fe_gradient}.
                              The graph never sees the density matrix -- only the stream.
14.2 Surprise as control       EARNED. surprise_bits is near-zero on a predictable world
     signal                    (0.006), spikes on a regime shift (1.50), decays as the engine
                              relearns (0.03). Usable for Lev attention/novelty/when-to-act.

# LAYER 15 — FORMAL PROOF LANE (the laws are FORCED, not fitted; Z3 ∧ cvc5 ∧ QuTiP)
################################################################################
15.1 Dual-solver axis laws     EARNED. Prior sims VERIFIED laws by enumeration ("all 8
                              terrains satisfy b6=-b0*b3"). This proves the stronger claim:
                              given the independently-earned physical bits, the laws are the
                              UNIQUE satisfying model -- their negation is UNSAT. Proven the
                              SAME way in Z3 AND cvc5, both agree (contract rule: z3 & cvc5
                              must agree). axis_laws_dual_proof.py.
15.2 XOR is the unique law     EARNED. Axis-0 = Axis-1 XOR Axis-2 is not just consistent -- it
                              is the UNIQUE 2-input boolean function g with a0=g(a1,a2) across
                              all 4 families, and it IS xor exactly. No other g fits.
15.3 Erased control flips      EARNED (the contract's "controls that flip it"). Erasing the Ni
                              constraint makes the XOR law NON-unique in both solvers -- proving
                              the constraint is load-bearing, not decorative. A claim whose
                              control does NOT flip would be vacuous.
15.4 b6 genuinely bilinear     EARNED. b6=-b0*b3: the coefficient is uniquely forced to -1, and
                              NO linear law b6=a*b0+b*b3+g fits any assignment. Same non-linear-
                              separability signature as the XOR result (a product, not a sum).
15.5 QuTiP operator cross-check EARNED. QuTiP's standard Lindblad liouvillian reproduces the
                              hand-rolled terrain superoperators to 2.2e-16 across all 8; all 8
                              flows are CPTP (QuTiP Choi PSD); nonunitality bits [1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0]
                              confirmed independently. terrain_qutip_crosscheck.py. A 5th
                              independent route (QIT library) at the operator level.
15.6 Portability               Both sims self-SKIP if z3/cvc5/qutip absent (import guard ->
                              SKIP_OPTIONAL, exit 0); harness counts as skip. GREEN on any machine.
15.7 8-of-16 access law        EARNED (Z3). Given the sheet law (t <-> t+4 opposite Weyl
                              chirality eps=+-1), the accessible-stage split is FORCED to 8/8 --
                              any non-4/4 terrain chirality is UNSAT. Left {t0-t3}/Right {t4-t7}
                              disjoint, union 16. manifold_laws_smt_proof.py.
15.8 pole-mirror pairing       EARNED with a logged FINDING. The dissipative pairs' fixed_z
                              sum to ~0, BUT zero-sum ALONE is degenerate -- (0,2)(4,6) and
                              (0,4)(2,6) both zero-sum (near-equal |fixed_z|). The pole-mirror
                              pairing (0,4)(2,6) is forced ONLY by zero-sum AND cross-sheet
                              (in<->out) together. Documented, not overclaimed -- exactly the
                              kind of near-degeneracy the proof lane exists to catch.
15.9 two-sector theorem        EARNED as a SYMBOLIC IDENTITY (sympy, exact -- not 2e-15).
                              Entropy is a function of eigenvalues only: eigs of rho(theta,phi)
                              = {p,1-p} for ALL eigenvector angles, and dS/dtheta = 0 exactly.
                              Entropy is IDENTICALLY blind to Axis-2 (the eigenvector/frame
                              sector) -- the exact reason every entropy readout collapsed to
                              Axis-1. The strongest possible form of the two-sector claim.

16.1 Landauer's principle      EARNED. The dissipative terrains RESET the qubit = logical
                              erasure. In the pure-dissipation limit S:1->0 bit (purity->1),
                              so the bath absorbs >= 1 bit = kT ln2 (2.87e-21 J @300K). The
                              coherent drive makes erasure PARTIAL, never cheaper than the
                              bound. Szilard's engine = the exact reverse. THE info<->physics
                              bridge, reproduced by the engine's own channels.
16.2 Einselection / pointer    EARNED. Zurek's predictability sieve: Ti (z-dephasing)
     states                    einselects {|0>,|1>} (they stay pure; superpositions -> 0.5);
                              Te einselects {|+>,|->}. Made EXACT: pointer states ARE the
                              purity-1 fixed points of the channel (Liouvillian null space),
                              coherences decay at rate 2. Einselection as an eigen-problem =
                              "an attractor basin that selects for itself" in decoherence
                              language -- selection built into the constraint, not added.

16.3 Jarzynski + Crooks        EARNED. The engine's UNITARY drive obeys the nonequilibrium
     fluctuation theorems      fluctuation theorems -- the exact generalization of the
                              Szilard/Landauer bound to ARBITRARY driving speed. Two-point
                              measurement on a driven qubit (thermal -> measure -> drive Hi->Hf
                              -> measure): <e^{-bW}> = e^{-b dF} to 3e-14 at EVERY tau
                              (fast=far-from-eq, slow=near); Crooks P_F(W)/P_R(-W)=e^{b(W-dF)}
                              across all work bins (Trotter-limited 3e-5); <W> >= dF always
                              (dissipated work W_diss drops 0.183->0.110 as the drive slows).
                              Chosen with a GENUINE dF=-0.793 so the equality is nontrivial.
                              FINDING (logged): the first Crooks pass FAILED at the tails --
                              a reverse-protocol bug (measured Hf but drove from Hi), NOT a
                              physics failure; fixing the time-reversed drive recovered the
                              law to Trotter tolerance (Crooks 3e-5; Jarzynski 3e-14). fluctuation_theorem_sim.py; fluctuation_theorem.png.

16.4 Quantum speed limit       EARNED. The engine's unitary drive obeys the QSL -- the
     (finitude + noncommutation) physical bound that ties the model's TWO CORE AXIOMS to
                              dynamics. Minimum time to an orthogonal state (hbar=1):
                              Levitin-Toffoli t_min=(pi/2)/max(dE,E-E0). (1) FINITUDE: the
                              drive SATURATES the bound (ratio 0.999, grid-limited) at every
                              energy; larger dE = faster (linearly). (2) NONCOMMUTATION:
                              [H,rho]!=0 <=> dE>0 <=> the state EVOLVES (three equivalent
                              conditions); a commuting H never moves (QSL=infinity). Full
                              orthogonality ADDITIONALLY needs |psi0> balanced across H's
                              eigenstates -- a tilted H evolves but only precesses part-way.
                              So noncommutation gates MOTION, finitude bounds SPEED, balance
                              gives full distinguishability. quantum_speed_limit_sim.py;

                              boundary caps shared information, peaking at the symmetric split;

                              = 0 for commuting bases (c=1), = log2(d)=1 bit for mutually
                              unbiased (Z vs X, c=1/2), TIGHT at the MUB limit. Noncommutation
                              IS uncertainty in bits. (2) CHSH: quantum |S|=2sqrt2 (Tsirelson,
                              exact) on an entangled state with noncommuting settings > classical
                              LHV bound 2; commuting-settings control |S|=1.41 cannot violate.
                              The excess above 2 is the sharpest signature that identity is
                              measurement-relative (a=a iff a~b). noncommutation_bounds_sim.py;

16.8 Holevo bound             EARNED. FINITUDE of readout: the accessible CLASSICAL
     (accessible info)        information in a quantum state is capped, any encoding or
                              measurement. I(X:Y) <= chi = S(sum p_x rho_x) - sum p_x S(rho_x)
                              <= log2(dim). (1) 1-bit code in 2 pure states: chi rises 0
                              (identical) -> 1 bit (orthogonal); NON-ORTHOGONAL (noncommuting)
                              signals lose accessible info. (2) chi is a TRUE upper bound -- the
                              best measurement over all angles never beats it. (3) DIMENSION
                              cap: 4 tetrahedral pure states (4 symbols) still give chi=1 bit,
                              not 2 -- a qubit carries <= log2(d) accessible bits. Ties a=a iff
                              a~b (probe-relative identity) to a capacity theorem. Purity
                              assertion guards the pure-state construction (a normalization slip
                              was caught: un-normalized Bloch vectors gave an unphysical chi>1).

16.9 Data-processing         EARNED. The monotone that makes the co-ratchet DIRECTIONAL:
     inequality (DPI)         information can only DECREASE under any physical channel. (1)
                              relative-entropy monotonicity S(N(rho)||N(sigma))<=S(rho||sigma)
                              -- distinguishability falls under dephasing (1.18->0.09). (2)
                              chain DPI I(A:C)<=I(A:B). Stress test: ZERO violations across 400
                              random CPTP channels for BOTH forms (min DPI margin >=0). This is
                              the arrow einselection/Landauer/Holevo all descend from -- ties
                              a=a iff a~b to a monotone: distinguishability is non-increasing
                              under the dissipative flow. data_processing_sim.py;

16.10 No-cloning theorem      EARNED. Linearity + finitude forbid copying an unknown state --
      (store, not copy)        the reason memory STORES but cannot DUPLICATE, and why the DPI
                              (16.9) is un-cheatable (you cannot copy-then-process to beat it).
                              (1) unitarity needs <a|b>=<a|b>^2, so |<a|b>| in {0,1}: only
                              ORTHOGONAL or IDENTICAL states clonable (copyable iff classically
                              distinct, a=a iff a~b). (2) CNOT basis-cloner: F=1 on |0>,|1> but
                              F=0.5 (entangled mess) on |+> -- no universal cloner. (3) the
                              Buzek-Hillery UQCM CONSTRUCTED and MEASURED: F=5/6 for EVERY input
                              (std 1e-16), finitude caps duplication below 1. Two bugs caught
                              by construct-and-measure (not hardcoding 5/6): a malformed partial
                              trace gave F>1, and non-orthogonal cloner branches broke
                              normalization -- both fixed, F=5/6 now exact and universal.

17.2 Bridge loopback ->        EARNED (with a finding). The Layer-16 physics/info bridges
     terrain enrichment       loop BACK into the engine: each of the 8 terrains is a GKSL
                              channel (the real engine objects), and the bridge observables
                              characterize them -- ||L(I)|| (einselection/nonunitality),
                              entropy-production rate (Landauer), coherence-kill rate
                              (einselection), Holevo chi preserved (16.8). RESULT: the 8
                              terrains sort into 3 MAX-DIFFERENTIATED dissipation classes --
                              damp {t0,t2,t4,t6} non-unital ||L(I)||=sqrt2, lowest coherence-
                              kill, highest chi; depol {t1,t5} middle; proj {t3,t7} highest
                              kill, lowest chi. Ordering damp<depol<proj (coherence-kill) AND
                              damp-unique-non-unital is FORCED: z3 AND cvc5 both SAT the law,
                              both UNSAT an erased swapped-order control (three-engine contract
                              satisfied -- SMT load-bearing, not decorative).
                              FINDING: these density-level observables separate the 3 KINDS but
                              NOT all 8 terrains individually -- within-class terrains are
                              degenerate here because the eps/pole (Axis-1/Axis-2) signs are the
                              documented density-level blindness (§7m). Full 8-way separation
                              needs the spinor-level tooling. terrain_information_signature_sim.py;

# THE OPEN ITEMS, CONSOLIDATED (what actually needs work, by priority)
################################################################################
O1  [CLOSED 2026-07-01] 5.6 — why exactly 2 native operators per terrain.
                 DERIVED from C2 (same-basis pairs commute exactly -> forbidden;
                 2 cross-basis survivors are W-conjugates, terrain frame picks one).
                 admissibility_two_operator_sim.py. No longer open.
O2  [DONE 2026-07-02] 10.4 — Julia engine RUN in-house (4th substrate); caught + fixed a
                 column-major vec-convention bug, now agrees with the oracle at 1q and 3q.
O3  [DONE 2026-07-01] 10.5 — 16-stage contract lifted to 3 qubits (C^8). Genuinely
                 multi-qubit (ZZ coupling, max negativity 0.038>0, not factorizing); readout
                 = 63-dim Pauli-expectation vector; 16 stages distinct (min pairwise 0.174);
                 8/8 fusion + 16/16 gaps preserved. numpy oracle vs JAX exact-expm agree
                 ~1e-12. oracle_targets_3q.py / jax_engine_3q.py / validate_engines_3q.py.
O4  [DECISION]   6.6 — the two-64s tension. Owner-only.
O5  [INTERP]     9.6/9.7 — Axis-0 parity is instrumented at the operator layer; a terrain-local
                 a2 meter is a proven no-go, so the terrain-level interpretation stays candidate.
O6  [MOSTLY DONE] holodeck/FEP memory + Lev bridge: memory (Layer 12), active-inference
                 learning (Layer 13), and the QIT->Lev signal-stream bridge STUB (Layer 14)
                 are built in pure QIT. STILL AHEAD: wire the bridge to the LIVE leviathan
                 repo (concrete node mapping + reverse action edge) and entropic-monism
                 cosmology (fenced). The engine side of active inference is ready; the
                 world/action model lives in Lev.
