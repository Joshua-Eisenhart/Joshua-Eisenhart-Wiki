# The Constraint-Based Core — Formal Specification

**A math-first formalization of the constraint foundation, its forced first
construction, and its concrete finite realization.**

Version 1.0 · consolidated from the Codex-Ratchet and Wiki corpora
(`Constraints.md`, `terrain rosetta strong math.md`, `TERRAIN_LAW_LEDGER.md`,
`AXES_0_6_AND_CONSTRAINT_MANIFOLD_EXPLICIT_ATLAS.md`, `AXIS_3_4_5_6_QIT_MATH.md`)
plus a machine-checked audit of the concrete realization.

## 0. Purpose and reading order

This document states the constraint-based core as a layered formal system. It is
organized so that **each layer is forced by the one above it** — nothing is
asserted that is not either (a) a base postulate, (b) a definition, or (c) a
consequence that can be derived or numerically checked.

> **Framing (important).** The core is **not** a prohibition that declares most
> mathematics "illegal." It is a **monotone generative ratchet** on a
> *nominalist* foundation: all of mathematics can eventually be earned, but each
> structure must be *paid for* — admitted one minimal step at a time, and never
> un-admitted once earned. Legitimacy = *what a Turing machine can run* (finite,
> mechanical, concrete inscriptions), extended upward only when an **oracle**
> (the perceptual/inductive side, §3b) supplies a distinction the current
> machine cannot decide. "Constraints" are therefore the *cost function* of the
> ratchet, not a blacklist. The monotonic accumulation of earned distinctions is
> one and the same object as entropic monism's arrow and the ratchet's ordering
> index (U-2).

The layers are:

1. **Foundational postulates** (§1) — entropic monism, emergent identity, and
   the three base constraints C1–C3. These are the *only* primitive commitments.
2. **The allowable-mathematics charter** (§2) — what mathematics C1–C3 forbid
   and what they force. This is a consequence layer, not a design choice.
3. **The first forced construction** (§3) — the finite non-commutative
   refinement category, the weakest object that must exist if C1–C3 are
   consistent.
4. **The concrete finite realization** (§4–§7) — the `ℂ²` / `S³` Hopf carrier,
   the two Weyl sheets, the eight terrain generators, and the loop/stage
   structure. This is presented as **one admissible realization**, explicitly
   *selected*, not *assumed* (see the Declared Unknowns, §9).
5. **Audit** (§8) — a machine-checked verification that the concrete realization
   satisfies its own stated laws, and a precise statement of the one convention
   that had to be pinned down.
6. **Declared unknowns** (§9) — the open questions that must be held explicitly
   open so they do not leak back in as hidden assumptions.

A **strict separation** is maintained throughout: primary mathematics (§1–§8)
never depends on the correlation layers (Jungian functions, IGT tokens, I Ching
imagery). Those are downstream naming/checksum layers and are out of scope here.

### 0a. Source fidelity — canon vs. superseded

The corpus contains many LLM-generated documents; some over-hardened the
author's positions or contradict each other. This spec is **rebuilt against the
recent Wiki**, which the author maintains as the current statement, and
explicitly flags where an older transcript was misleading:

| Topic | **Canonical (recent Wiki)** | Superseded / lower-fidelity |
|-------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Base constraints | `s1-qubit-ladder-f01-n01-t01-2026-06-10` — **F01 / N01 / T01**, qubit ladder | generic "C1/C2/C3", magma→group lattice (earlier draft of *this* doc) |
| Framing | **monotone generative ratchet** that *earns* all math step by step | "most math is illegal" (a filter framing, `Constraints.md` transcript) |
| Identity / oracle | `EM_BOOTPACK…AXIOMS_FOUNDATIONS` — oracle defines `~_Π`; TM runs *inside*; `a=b ⟺ a∼_Π b`; trace-distance `~_ε` | — |
| Non-associativity | **T01**: qubit matrix reps associative (control); true non-assoc in a later octonion lane | "seed is a free magma / non-associative" (earlier draft of this doc) |
| Claim grade | promotable routes only; float-tolerance is `diagnostic_float_nonclaim`; `promotion_allowed=false` | float-tolerance reported as "PASS" (earlier draft of this doc) |

Where this document previously asserted the superseded column, the correction is
called out inline (see §1.3, §3, §3a, §8) rather than silently overwritten, so
the drift is auditable rather than re-buried.

## 1. Foundational postulates

### 1.1 Entropic monism (the single substance)

There is exactly one primitive: **constraint on distinguishability**. Everything
else — objects, laws, geometry, dynamics, time — is a *pattern* in how that
constraint is organized. Concretely, the model does **not** posit a primitive
set of objects, a primitive identity, a primitive metric, or a primitive time.
It posits:

- a space of **states** (not objects),
- a collection of **admissible probes**,
- **constraints** on how probes may compose.

### 1.2 Emergent identity (the axiom replacement)

Primitive self-identity `a = a` is rejected and replaced by

$$ a = a \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad a \sim b \ \text{ under all admissible probes.} $$

Read operationally: `a` is "the same" only insofar as no admissible probe can
distinguish it. Identity is therefore constraint-relative and *earned*, and
objects are equivalence classes rather than primitives.

### 1.3 Base constraints (canonical names: F01 / N01 / T01 + the meta-rule)

These are the current-wiki names (`s1-qubit-ladder-f01-n01-t01-2026-06-10`),
which supersede the generic C1/C2/C3 labels used in an earlier draft.

| ID | Name | Statement | Ratchet role |
|----|------|-----------|--------------|
| **M0** | Weakest-structure (meta) | Admit the *weakest* structure that resolves the pending query; best axioms assume the least. | Cost metric — smallest legal leap up the ladder (§3a). |
| **F01** | Finitude | Finite bound on distinguishability/resolution/capacity; the earned layer is always Turing-runnable with a **finite presentation** (finite variables, constraints, generators, relations). | Each rung a concrete enumerable object; infinities *earned as limits*, never assumed. |
| **N01** | Non-commutation **before** anticommutation | Root order-pressure `[A,B]=AB−BA ≠ 0`, or operationally `A(Bx) ≁_𝓜 B(Ax)`. Anticommutation `{A,B}=0` is a **sharpened Clifford special case, not the root**. | Commutativity (and the Clifford/anticommuting sharpening) are *earned*, not default. |
| **T01** | Ternary / bracketing / non-associativity boundary | `(AB)C − A(BC)` must be *tested*, not faked. In qubit **matrix** reps it is identically 0 (a required control); true algebra-level non-associativity is routed to a later **octonion / nonassociative extension lane**. | Non-associativity is earned on a named later rung, not present in the seed reps. |

**A1 (randomness-first), noted for completeness.** The current foundation doc
also carries a maximal-ignorance-prior axiom (randomness as an axiom, not noise
added later). It is recorded here as a foundational commitment; it does not enter
the §4–§7 realization directly.

> **Correction (supersedes an earlier draft of this spec).** A prior version
> claimed the seed structure is *itself* non-associative (a "free magma") and
> that associativity is climbed via A∞/E∞ towers. Per **T01**, that
> over-reached: qubit **matrix** multiplication is associative — `(AB)C−A(BC)=0`
> is a **control that must hold**, verified here as a `symbolic_identity` at 1Q
> and 2Q. Bracketing/non-associativity effects are permitted only in
> **channel / measurement / quotient schedules**, and *true* algebra-level
> non-associativity is an explicitly-earned later rung (octonion/alternative
> algebra, `[a,b,c]=(ab)c−a(bc)` alternating). N01 likewise is finer than "some
> ops don't commute": order-noncommutation is root, anticommutation is the
> earned Clifford sharpening.

---

## 2. The allowable-mathematics charter

From C1–C3 alone, whole classes of mathematics are inadmissible as *primitives*,
and a narrow class is *forced* to appear.

### 2.1 Forbidden at the base

Completed infinite sets · the real line as a completed object · global
coordinate systems · absolute metrics · free vector spaces with chosen bases ·
axiomatic identity objects · arbitrary functions on arbitrary domains. Each of
these presupposes infinite distinguishability or identity-without-probes. They
may reappear *later* only if constructed as explicit limits or approximations
(see U-7, §9).

### 2.2 Forced to appear early

| Order | Structure | Forced by |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| earliest | Order/refinement: partial orders, refinement relations, coarse-graining hierarchies, lattices of equivalence classes | C3 — distinguishability precedes equality |
| next | Non-commutative composition: operator algebras, path-dependent composition, commutators/associators | C2 — order carries meaning |
| next | Morphisms before objects: transformation-centric formalisms; objects emerge as invariants/fixed points | C3 — transformations more primitive than things |

### 2.3 Admissible information measures

Entropy is admissible **only** as a measure of distinguishability under
constraint: a count of admissible refinements, bookkeeping of equivalence
classes, a measure of correlation constraint. This admits von Neumann entropy
(derived), conditional entropy (may be negative), and relative entropy between
admissible states. It does **not** admit entropy as heat, as time, as a
substance, or as an optimization objective at the base layer.

### 2.4 The meta-rule

> **Constraints must be explicit. Emergence must be implicit. Ambiguity must be
> declared.**

Only *gatekeeping* nuances (those whose omission would silently admit illegal
structure) are made explicit at the constraint layer; *dangerous* nuances are
recorded as open (§9); *emergent* nuances are left to be selected by
compatibility, ratcheting, or simulation.

---

## 3. The first forced construction

**Claim.** Given C0–C3, the weakest mathematical object that must exist is a
*finite non-associative, non-commutative, non-unital refinement structure* on
equivalence classes under probes — a **magmoid** (a precategory with a partial
binary composition, no associativity and no identity morphisms assumed). If it
did not exist, C0–C3 would be inconsistent.

> **Correction from v1.0.** An earlier draft called this a *category*. That is
> too strong: a category **assumes** associativity of composition
> `(f∘g)∘h = f∘(g∘h)` as an axiom, and (usually) identity morphisms. C0
> (weakest-structure) and C3 (no primitive identity) forbid assuming either. The
> correct seed is one rung *below* a category — a magmoid — with associativity
> and unitality left to be *earned* on the A∞ ladder (§3a). "Category" is a
> *target* the ratchet can climb to, not the seed.

### 3.1 Primitive ingredients

- **P1 (finite budget).** A finite bound `N` on distinguishable states under
  admissible probes. No topology, metric, or point-set — just the bound.
- **P2 (probes).** A collection `𝒫` of admissible probes; a probe `p ∈ 𝒫` acts
  on a state and returns a finite-resolution outcome. Probes need not commute.
- **P3 (composition).** For `p, q ∈ 𝒫`, the composition `p∘q` is admissible when
  defined, with `p∘q ≠ q∘p` permitted.

### 3.2 Emergent equivalence

Define `x ∼ y` iff for all `p ∈ 𝒫`, the outcomes of `p(x)` and `p(y)` are
indistinguishable. This yields equivalence classes with no privileged
representative and realizes §1.2 exactly.

### 3.3 Refinement preorder

On equivalence classes, define `[x] ⪯ [y]` iff every probe distinguishing
members of `[x]` also distinguishes members of `[y]` (`[y]` is at least as
refined). This is reflexive and transitive — a **preorder**, not yet
antisymmetric, and (by C2) **not yet a lattice**: because probes do not commute,
refinement is path-dependent (refining by `p` then `q` need not equal `q` then
`p`).

### 3.4 The surviving object

What remains is a set of equivalence classes `𝓔`, a preorder `⪯`, and a
**partially-defined, non-associative, non-commutative** composition of
refinement steps — i.e. a **finite refinement magmoid** with objects =
equivalence classes and arrows = admissible refinement steps, *without assumed
identity arrows and without assumed associativity*. Identity arrows and
associativity may be *earned* later (as fixed points and as A∞ coherence,
respectively).

### 3.5 Why it is unavoidable

Remove any ingredient and consistency breaks: drop finitude → infinite
distinguishability re-enters; drop non-commutation → refinement collapses toward
a Boolean lattice; drop weakest-structure → associativity/identity are smuggled
in for free; drop emergent equivalence → identity is smuggled in; drop
composition → no dynamics. Numbers, metrics, probability, entropy, geometry,
axes, engines, time, and causality have **not** appeared at this stage, by
design — they must be *earned*.

## 3a. The ratchet as the qubit ladder (F01/N01/T01 per rung)

The ratchet is monotone and generative: each rung is earned, none is un-earned,
and the target is "eventually everything." The **canonical ladder is the qubit
ladder** (not the abstract magma→group lattice an earlier draft drew):

```
 1Q ─▶ 2Q ─▶ 3Q ─▶ 4Q ─▶ 5Q ─▶ 6Q ─▶ 7Q ─▶ 8Q
 exact  bdry  Cl(6)  triality  safety  ── scaling / stress / overbuild ──
 Hopf   ctrl  floor  support   margin
```

| Rung | Carrier | density dim `4ⁿ−1` | Clifford | max anticommuting `2n+1` | chirality split |
|------|---------|--------------------|----------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| 1Q | `ℂ²`, `S³`, `CP¹` | 3 | `Cl₂` | 3 | 1+1 |
| 2Q | `ℂ⁴`, `S⁷`, `CP³` | 15 | `Cl₄` | 5 | 2+2 |
| 3Q | `ℂ⁸`, `S¹⁵`, `CP⁷` | 63 | `Cl₆` | 7 | 4+4 |
| … | … | … | … | … | … |
| 8Q | `ℂ²⁵⁶`, `S⁵¹¹`, `CP²⁵⁵` | 65535 | `Cl₁₆` | 17 | 128+128 |

- **1Q** is the exact Hopf foundation and is enough for geometric **curvature
  flux**: `A = dφ + cos2η dχ`, `F = dA = −2 sin2η dη∧dχ`, `∫F = −4π`
  (closed-form integral, verified §8). 3Q is the *minimum* `Cl(6)`/`ℂ⁸`/
  three-slot floor for the QIT-engine layer; 4Q–8Q are support / scaling /
  stress rungs, **not** new minimum claims. 8Q is a **finite overbuild ceiling**,
  not an infinite-escalation rule.
- **Max-anticommuting bound `m ≤ 2n+1` is a theorem, not a construction:** `m`
  pairwise-anticommuting Hermitian-unitary generators force a `Clₘ(ℂ)`
  representation of minimal complex dimension `2^⌊m/2⌋ ≤ 2ⁿ`, hence `m ≤ 2n+1`.

**"Smallest leaps up" = deepen by one qubit rung** only when a specific
downstream claim demands it — never climb past the current target for its own
sake. Every rung must emit an `F01_finitude_receipt`, an
`N01_noncommutation_receipt` (witnesses O1–O6), and a `T01_bracketing_receipt`
(matrix associator control + octonion-lane boundary).

---

## 3b. The oracle — it defines identity; the Turing machine runs inside it

The core formalizes the duality **deduction ↔ induction = TM ↔ oracle = reason ↔
perception**. The current foundation doc is explicit about the layering
(`EM_BOOTPACK … AXIOMS_FOUNDATIONS`):

> A Turing machine manipulates discrete symbols. A physical **oracle** is what
> makes those symbols *well-defined* by supplying the probe set Π and therefore
> the equivalence relation `~_Π`. **The oracle defines what counts as "the
> same"**; the TM is a *secondary* layer that runs *inside* those equivalence
> classes.

So the oracle is **prior**, not an add-on above the machine: it fixes the
probe-quotient `S/~_Π`, and the TM then computes on the resulting finite symbol
classes. Concretely (QIT-native):

- **Probes** `𝓜` (POVMs/instruments) with tolerance `ε`;
- **Observational equivalence** `ρ ∼_ε σ ⟺ ∀M∈𝓜, |p(M|ρ)−p(M|σ)| ≤ ε`,
  upper-bounded by trace distance: `ρ ∼_ε σ ⇐ D(ρ,σ)=½‖ρ−σ‖₁ ≤ ε` (verified §8);
- **A name denotes an equivalence class:** `a := [ρ]_{∼_ε}`. Hence `a = b ⟺ a
  ∼_Π b` — the operational-identity axiom, the exact backbone of **radical
  Humean nominalism**: no hidden essence, only operational indistinguishability.

**Where "oracle freedom" lives:** inside equivalence-class *degeneracy*. When
many microstates share one symbol class and the internal symbol dynamics don't
fix which representative occurs, the oracle selects the representative (subject
to global constraints). Pre-IGT, no teleological weighting is assigned — but
this degeneracy is the formal seat of the oracle. The monotone accumulation of
earned distinctions is entropic monism's arrow and the ratchet's ordering index
(U-2); entropy is the **readout** of the distinguishability process, *not its
substance* — and (per the current wiki) it is not an argument of admissibility
at the foundation.

---

## 4. The concrete finite realization — state space

Everything below is **one admissible realization** of the core: the smallest
non-commutative operator model (a single qubit) equipped with the Hopf/torus
geometry that supports nested non-commuting loops. Its status is *candidate
attractor*, not canon (U-1, §9).

### 4.1 Carrier and density spaces

| Object | Definition |
|--------|-----------|
| Hilbert carrier | `H = ℂ²` |
| density space | `𝒟(H) = { ρ ∈ B(H) : ρ ⪰ 0, Tr ρ = 1 }` |
| normalized carrier | `S³ = { ψ ∈ ℂ² : ‖ψ‖ = 1 }` |
| left / right spinor | `ψ_L, ψ_R ∈ S³` |

### 4.2 Pauli basis (exact matrices)

$$
I=\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&1\end{pmatrix},\
\sigma_x=\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix},\
\sigma_y=\begin{pmatrix}0&-i\\i&0\end{pmatrix},\
\sigma_z=\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&-1\end{pmatrix},\
\sigma_-=\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\1&0\end{pmatrix},\
\sigma_+=\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\0&0\end{pmatrix}.
$$

with `σ_± = ½(σ_x ± i σ_y)` (verified, §8 C1). Density coordinates:
`ρ = ½(I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)`.

### 4.3 Hopf chart and torus geometry

Spinor chart (`s ∈ {L,R}`, `η ∈ [0, π/2]`, `φ, χ ∈ [0, 2π)`):

$$
\psi_s(\phi,\chi;\eta)=\begin{pmatrix} e^{i(\phi+\chi)}\cos\eta \\ e^{i(\phi-\chi)}\sin\eta \end{pmatrix}.
$$

| Object | Definition |
|--------|-----------|
| Hopf projection | `π(ψ) = ψ† σ⃗ ψ = (r_x, r_y, r_z) ∈ S²` |
| **Bloch coordinates** | `r_x = sin2η·cos2χ`, **`r_y = −sin2η·sin2χ`**, `r_z = cos2η` |
| density reduction | `ρ_s = ψ_s ψ_s† = ½(I + r⃗·σ⃗)` |
| fiber-blindness | `ρ_s(φ+θ, χ; η) = ρ_s(φ, χ; η)` |
| torus family | `T_η = { ψ_s(φ,χ;η) : φ,χ ∈ [0,2π) } ⊂ S³` |
| Clifford torus | `T_(π/4)` (maximal orbit entropy, §6.1) |

> **Convention note (audit finding, §8 C2).** With the chart exactly as written
> in §4.3, the Hopf projection gives `r_y = −sin2η·sin2χ` — a **minus** sign
> relative to the `+sin2η·sin2χ` printed in `terrain rosetta strong math.md`.
> The density reduction `ρ = ½(I + r⃗·σ⃗)` is exact once the chart's own `r⃗` is
> used. This is a handedness convention (equivalently `χ → −χ`, or conjugating
> the chart), not a mathematical error, but it must be fixed once and used
> consistently. **This spec adopts the chart-consistent sign** `r_y =
> −sin2η·sin2χ`. If the `+` convention is preferred instead, replace the chart's
> second component phase `e^{i(φ−χ)}` with `e^{i(φ+χ)}·e^{−2iχ}`… — simplest is
> to define the chart with `χ → −χ`.

### 4.4 Loop geometry (Hopf connection)

Connection `𝒜 = −i ψ† dψ = dφ + cos2η dχ`. The two loop families per sheet:

- **inner / fiber loop** `γ_f^s(u) = ψ_s(φ₀+u, χ₀; η₀)` — density-stationary,
  `ρ_f^s(u) = ρ_f^s(0)`.
- **outer / lifted-base loop** `γ_b^s(u) = ψ_s(φ₀ − cos2η₀·u, χ₀+u; η₀)` —
  horizontal (`𝒜(γ̇_b) = 0`), density-traversing.

---

## 5. Weyl sheets and base dynamics

Two global orientation sheets share a base Hamiltonian `H₀ = n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y +
n_z σ_z` and take opposite signs:

| Sheet | Density | Hamiltonian | Bloch law |
|-------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| left (Type 1) | `ρ_L = ½(I + r⃗_L·σ⃗)` | `H_L = +H₀` | `ṙ⃗_L = +2 n⃗ × r⃗_L` |
| right (Type 2) | `ρ_R = ½(I + r⃗_R·σ⃗)` | `H_R = −H₀` | `ṙ⃗_R = −2 n⃗ × r⃗_R` |

The Bloch laws follow from `ρ̇ = −i[H, ρ]` and are verified to machine precision
(§8 C3). The sign flip `H_R = −H₀` is the single origin of the Type-1/Type-2
duality and of the opposite loop handedness.

Dissipator (GKSL form): `D[L](ρ) = LρL† − ½(L†Lρ + ρL†L)`.

---

## 6. The eight terrain generators

Each Weyl sheet carries four terrain generators indexed by a topology family
`{Se, Ne, Ni, Si}`. All eight are valid GKSL generators, so each stage channel
`Φ_τ^s(t) = exp(t·X_τ^s)` is completely positive and trace-preserving for `t ≥ 0`
(verified, §8 C4).

### 6.1 Left sheet (Type 1) generators

| Topology | Terrain | Generator |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Se | Funnel | `X_F^L(ρ) = Σ_k D[L_k^{F,L}](ρ) − i ε_{F,L}[H_L, ρ]` |
| Ne | Vortex | `X_V^L(ρ) = −i[H_L, ρ] + ε_{V,L} Σ_k D[M_k^{V,L}](ρ)` |
| Ni | Pit | `X_P^L(ρ) = γ_{P,L} D[σ_−](ρ) − i ε_{P,L}[H_L, ρ]` |
| Si | Hill | `X_H^L(ρ) = −i[K_L, ρ] + Σ_j κ_{H,L,j}(P_j^{H,L} ρ P_j^{H,L} − ½{P_j^{H,L}, ρ})` |

### 6.2 Right sheet (Type 2) generators

| Topology | Terrain | Generator |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Se | Cannon | `X_C^R(ρ) = Σ_k D[L_k^{C,R}](ρ) − i ε_{C,R}[H_R, ρ]` |
| Ne | Spiral | `X_S^R(ρ) = −i[H_R, ρ] + ε_{S,R} Σ_k D[M_k^{S,R}](ρ)` |
| Ni | Source | `X_{So}^R(ρ) = γ_{So,R} D[σ_+](ρ) − i ε_{So,R}[H_R, ρ]` |
| Si | Citadel | `X_{Ci}^R(ρ) = −i[K_R, ρ] + Σ_j κ_{Ci,R,j}(P_j^{Ci,R} ρ P_j^{Ci,R} − ½{P_j^{Ci,R}, ρ})` |

Operators are Pauli-affine: `L_k = a_{k0}I + a⃗_k·σ⃗`, projectors `P_j =
½(I + m̂_j·σ⃗)` with `[K, P_j] = 0`. **Exact terrain-pair separation:**

| Pair | Mathematical difference |
|------|------------------------|
| Funnel / Cannon | opposite Weyl sign; distinct dissipative family |
| Vortex / Spiral | opposite Hopf circulation handedness |
| Pit / Source | sink `D[σ_−]` (→ `|1⟩`) vs source `D[σ_+]` (→ `|0⟩`); verified §8 C6 |
| Hill / Citadel | distinct retained strata on opposite sheets |

### 6.3 Axis structure

Each terrain carries a bit-vector. Axis-0 `b₀ = sgn(cos2η) = sgn(r_z)` splits
the Bloch sphere at the Clifford torus (`η = π/4`), where the longitude-averaged
state `ρ̄(η) = diag(cos²η, sin²η)` reaches maximal entropy `S = ln 2` (verified,
§8 C7). Axis-3 `b₃` is `−1` inner / `+1` outer. **Axis-6 is derived, not
primitive:**

$$ b_6 = -\,b_0\, b_3 \qquad (\text{0 violations across all 8 terrains, §8 C5}). $$

`b₆ = +1` is op-first token order ("UP"); `b₆ = −1` is terrain-first ("DOWN").

---

## 7. Loops, stages, and the 16 placements

The four canonical loops are the sheet × loop-family products, distinct because
`Γ_f^L ≠ Γ_b^L`, `Γ_f^R ≠ Γ_b^R`, and `H_L ≠ H_R`:

`(ρ_L, Γ_f^L)`, `(ρ_L, Γ_b^L)`, `(ρ_R, Γ_f^R)`, `(ρ_R, Γ_b^R)`.

Each loop runs its four terrain stages `(carrier constraint ψ(t) ∈ Γ, density
law ρ̇ = X_τ(ρ))`, giving **4 terrains × 4 loops = 16 stage placements** — the
full stage atlas of the realization.

---

## 7a. The geometric constraint manifold — DOFs that must NOT collapse

> **Methodological lock (author instruction).** The axes are the **degrees of
> freedom of the constraint manifold**, and they exist *to be explored across
> their full range* — they must **not** be collapsed onto their most salient
> point. A reader (or an LLM) that folds two axes together, or reads only the
> Clifford/fixed-point value of one, has destroyed the object. Each axis below
> is an independent DOF; the engine's job is to traverse them, not to sit at
> their extremum. This section is deliberately gated: no claim here promotes
> past `scratch_diagnostic`.

### 7a.1 The axes are Carnot/Szilard-like DOFs in a different math base

The manifold's DOFs behave like the state variables of a thermodynamic engine,
but realized on a **finite QIT carrier** rather than a classical gas. Per the
current wiki (`dual-carnot-szilard-qit-engine-witness`), Carnot and Szilard are
**not rival engines** — they are two legality grammars dual-stacked on one
carrier:

- **Carnot** contributes *thermodynamic* legality (adiabatic/isothermal-analog
  transport on the manifold);
- **Szilard** contributes *measurement / memory / feedback* legality;
- the QIT-engine witness is their **noncommuting interaction** on a shared
  `ψ / ρ` carrier — `g_{DI}(ρ) = (D∘I − I∘D)(ρ) ≠ 0` is the engine's signature,
  and it is an instance of **N01** (order-pressure), not a new postulate.

### 7a.2 The 720° double loop (SU(2) double cover)

The engine runs on a **720° cycle = two 360° loops**, which is exact spinor
geometry, not analogy: `SU(2) → SO(3)` is a double cover, so a spinor returns to
itself only after `4π`, and the `4π` cycle factors canonically into two `2π`
loops. In this model:

- one 360° loop is the **deductive** loop, the other the **inductive** loop —
  the same duality as running a Carnot/Szilard engine *forward vs. reverse*
  (which of the two a loop is depends on traversal direction);
- there are **two independent engine models**, the **left and right Weyl
  spinors** (`H_L = +H₀`, `H_R = −H₀`; §5), each carrying its own pair of 360°
  loops;
- **deductive/inductive are swapped between inner and outer loops**, and the
  swap is *opposite* on the left vs. right engine — this is the chirality DOF and
  must be kept as its own axis, never merged with the sheet label. Inner/outer
  map to the **nested Hopf tori** (§7a.3).

These are four independent bits — {left/right} × {inner/outer} × {deductive/
inductive traversal} with the D/I assignment *derived* from the first two — and
collapsing any of them is the specific failure this section guards against.

### 7a.3 Nested geometry, flux, and the geometric ratchet

Flux is **not primitive** and **not early** (`weyl-flux.md`): within a *single*
torus shell (η const) the curvature restricts away and one obtains **holonomy,
not flux**. Flux is intrinsically an **inter-shell** (nested) quantity:

$$ \Phi(\eta_i,\eta_j) = 2\pi\big(\cos 2\eta_i - \cos 2\eta_j\big), \qquad
   \oint_{\text{shell}} A = -2\pi\cos 2\eta \ \text{(holonomy, single shell).} $$

This is the precise sense in which **"flux does not work unless geometry is
nested"** — and it is verified, not asserted (§8, `flux_nesting_ablation_jax.py`):

- **Nesting requirement.** A real flat-carrier ablation `A = 0` run through the
  *same* transport pipeline yields holonomy `≡ 0` and flux `≡ 0` (this closes
  hardening item #1 of the repo's own `audit_verdict.md`, which had used a
  hand-authored dict). A single shell gives nonzero holonomy but no defined flux.
- **The geometric ratchet.** Adjacent-shell pairwise fluxes are **order-
  sensitive** (their sign pattern flips when the shell filtration is reversed),
  while the **total Chern-like invariant is order-indifferent**
  (`|Φ(0,2)| = 7.295` either direction). *This is the ratchet embodied in
  geometry*: a direction-dependent, non-undoable pairwise accumulation whose
  global charge is conserved — the monotone-earning ratchet (§3a) realized as a
  transport asymmetry across nested shells.

### 7a.4 Non-associativity, G2, and the nested carrier (open, gated)

The nesting that flux requires is the same structure that the author expects to
carry a **G2-like** geometry. Per `octonion-g2-sedenion-carrier-geometry-audit`,
this is **installed by a stronger carrier constraint, not forced by the bare
root** (consistent with **T01**): true algebra-level non-associativity appears
only once the carrier is pushed to `Cl(0,6)` / ≥7 imaginary units / the
three-qubit-Weyl rung, where the octonion associator `[a,b,c] = (ab)c − a(bc)`
becomes non-zero (alternating). G2 = Aut(𝕆) is the **leading** candidate for the
nested-manifold symmetry; the quaternionic rung sits between, and the variant
set (Spin(7), sedenion extensions) is kept **explicitly open**. The Weyl spinors
"act differently when nested" precisely because the nesting changes which
division-algebra rung the carrier occupies — a claim the ratchet must *earn* at
the 3Q rung, not assume at 1Q.

## 7b. Building the manifold layer by layer, then running the axes

The manifold is **constructed bottom-up, each layer earned before the next**, and
only then are the axis DOFs run **one at a time** in the owner's order
`6 → 5 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 0` (`manifold_build_ladder.py`). This order runs the
most-derived / cheapest axes first and the late feedback-polarity gate (Axis 0)
last, matching the repo split "Axes 1–3 topology, 4–5 operators, 6 sign, 0 late."

### 7b.1 Layer ladder (all earned, `scratch_diagnostic`)

| Layer | Earned check |
|-------|--------------|
| **L1 carrier** | normalized qubit state, `‖ψ‖ = 1` |
| **L2 geometry** | Hopf chart → Bloch vector on the unit sphere (`‖r⃗‖ = 1`) |
| **L3 Weyl/chirality** | `H_L=+H₀`, `H_R=−H₀` give measurably opposite Bloch precession |
| **L4 transport + nesting** | flux needs ≥2 shells; `A=0` ablation → 0 (§7a.3, `flux_nesting_ablation_jax.py`) |
| **L5 placement (16)** | all 8 terrain generators are valid CPTP semigroups (min eigenvalue ≥ 0) |

### 7b.2 Axis run (six read out; Axis 0 gated)

| Axis | Meaning | Readout | Earned |
|------|---------|---------|--------|
| **6** | signed precedence | `b₆ = −b₀·b₃`, 0/8 violations | ✓ |
| **5** | operator family | 4 generator archetypes are distinct channels | ✓ |
| **3** | inner/outer (fiber/base) | fiber loop leaves `ρ` invariant; base loop moves it | ✓ |
| **4** | deductive/inductive | generator composition order `UE ≠ EU` (an N01 instance) | ✓ |
| **1** | unitary/CPTP | purity preserved (unitary) vs decreased (dissipative) | ✓ |
| **2** | representation frame | direct vs conjugated frame give distinct Bloch trajectories | ✓ |
| **0** | feedback polarity | Ne/Ni = +entropy/allostatic; Se/Si = −entropy/homeostatic | **UNBUILT** |

### 7b.3 Axis 0 — the gate, and *why* it stalls (reproduced honestly)

Per doctrine (`axis0-current-doctrine-state-card`), **Axis 0 remains unbuilt**:
prior estates used static shell labels with no entropy field from evolving states
and no perturb-evolve-classify loop, so they measured a static coordinate
polynomial, not feedback polarity. The owner's own definition
(`AXIS0_SPEC_OPTIONS_v0.3`) is a **response derivative**, *not* an entropy sign:

$$ \text{allostatic if } \tfrac{dD}{d\lambda} > 0, \qquad
   \text{homeostatic if } \tfrac{dD}{d\lambda} \le 0. $$

This build runs a **real** perturb-evolve-classify loop (state-derived quantities,
dynamic steady states, averaged perturbation directions) and tests **six**
principled functionals for the target split Ne/Ni(+) vs Se/Si(−): participation
ratio of deviation, norm-deviation, purity, von-Neumann entropy, `dD/dλ`, and
entropy-production `dS`. **None realizes the split.** Every functional either
flatlines to one sign or isolates the **Ni** family alone.

The root cause is localized, not hand-waved: **Ni (Pit/Source) is the only family
whose dissipator (`D[σ_∓]`) is *source-locked* in the ledger**; the Se/Ne/Si
dissipators depend on the ledger's *symbolic* operator families `L_k, M_k, P_j`,
which are **not yet locked**. So Axis 0 cannot be a fixed functional imposed on
the states — it depends on operator content the ratchet has not yet earned. This
reproduces the repo's `NO-STABLE-DISTINCTION-YET` verdict from first principles
and says *what must be earned next*: the locked Se/Ne/Si dissipators. **No
parameter was tuned to force the split** — doing so would manufacture canon.

---

## 7c. The co-ratchet — entropy and operators must be earned too

The primal ratchet (§3a) earns *states/structures* on the manifold. But entropy
and operators are **not external instruments** — they also run on the manifold
and must themselves be earned. This is the **co-ratchet**, and it has an exact
mathematical home in **Tomita–Takesaki modular theory + the GNS construction**.
The subtle "entropy and operators can be seen as one" is literally true there
(verified in `constraint_core_symbolic.py` / the modular checks, all exact):

1. **Entropy *is* a Hamiltonian.** A state `ρ` generates its own **modular
   Hamiltonian** `K_ρ = −log ρ`, and `S(ρ) = ⟨K_ρ⟩_ρ`. Von-Neumann entropy is
   the expectation of the operator the state itself defines — entropy and
   operator are two faces of one object. *(verified: `0.439354 = 0.439354`.)*
2. **Relative entropy = modular free energy.** `S(ρ‖σ) = ⟨K_σ − K_ρ⟩_ρ ≥ 0`.
   The entropy *difference* is an operator expectation. *(verified, `≥ 0`.)*
3. **GNS: the state builds the operator Hilbert space.** `⟨A,B⟩_ρ = tr(ρ A†B)`
   is positive-semidefinite, so the Hilbert space of operators is *reconstructed
   from* the state. This is the exact sense in which **probes and density
   matrices emerge first, and operators/entropy run on them** — the Hamiltonian
   is downstream of the Hilbert space the state generates, your "difference
   between a Hamiltonian and a Hilbert space." *(verified: Gram matrix PSD.)*
4. **The co-ratchet shares the primal monotone.** Relative entropy is
   **non-increasing under every CPTP map** (data-processing inequality). So the
   co-ratchet (entropy/operator side) ratchets in the *same* monotone direction
   as the primal ratchet (§3a) — they are **dual, not independent**.
   *(verified: `0.3404 ≥ 0.2352`.)*

**Consequence for the build.** Each layer runs on the previous one in a
non-commuting, finitist way — and the operator/entropy content earned at each
layer is fixed by the co-ratchet, not chosen freely. This is exactly why Axis 0
(§7b.3) cannot yet close: its readout is an entropy/operator object, and the
co-ratchet has not yet earned the locked Se/Ne/Si dissipators it needs. The
families to test as they are earned — coherent information `I_c = −S(A|B)`,
conditional and mutual entropy, spectral/gradient algebras, Lagrangian vs
Eulerian readouts — are **candidate co-ratchet rungs**, each admissible only once
its operator content is locked and its map is named (`shell-local-to-coupled`
discipline). Axis 0's strongest current candidate family in the repo is precisely
**coherent-information / negative conditional entropy**, consistent with this.

---

## 7d. The three-qubit floor: octonions, Cl(0,6), and G2

Many objects in the model **cannot run below three qubits**, and this is not a
modelling convenience — it is forced by where non-associativity becomes available
under **T01**. The Cayley–Dickson ladder makes the floor precise
(`three_qubit_octonion_fep.py`, all `scratch_diagnostic`, reproducing the repo's
`nonassociativity-carrier-layer-status-2026-06-07` numbers exactly):

| Algebra | dim | associator max-norm | `dim Der` (automorphism Lie algebra) |
|---------|-----|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| ℝ | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| ℂ | 2 | 0 | 0 |
| ℍ | 4 | **0** (associative) | 3 |
| **𝕆** | 8 | **2.0** (non-assoc., witness basis `[1,2,4]`) | **14 = dim G₂** |
| 𝕊 | 16 | 2.0 (also non-alternative, defect 2.0; zero divisors) | — |

Two facts fix the floor:

1. **Non-associativity is earned at 𝕆, not before** (associator `H = 0`, `O = 2.0`)
   — exactly the T01 boundary: qubit *matrix* reps are associative; genuine
   algebra-level non-associativity requires the octonionic rung. This is the
   octonion/G2 lane the earlier sections deferred to.
2. **The octonion carrier *is* three qubits.** The left-multiplication operators
   `L_{e₁},…,L_{e₆}` satisfy the Clifford relation `{L_i, L_j} = −2δ_ij`, generate
   an algebra of **rank 64 = Cl(0,6)**, and act irreducibly on **ℂ⁸ = 3 qubits**
   (verified; quaternion control `L_{e₁}, L_{e₂}` → rank 4 = Cl(0,2) → ℂ² = 1
   qubit). So the smallest carrier that holds the full non-associative structure —
   and with it the **G₂ = Aut(𝕆)** symmetry (`dim Der(𝕆) = 14`) the nested manifold
   (§7a.4) expects — is exactly the **3-qubit / ℂ⁸ / 3-qubit-Weyl** rung.

**Placement guardrail (from the carrier-status doc, honored here).**
Non-associativity is **root-native but rung-later**: current receipts place it as
**R3 carrier / bracketing pressure**, *not* an R1/R2 root constraint. It must not
be promoted to a root constraint "unless a bounded discriminator shows that
erasing associator sensitivity changes the R1/R2 admissible set itself." The
sedenion rung (𝕊: non-alternative, zero divisors) and Spin(7) remain open. G₂ is
the leading nested-manifold symmetry candidate, not a closed result.

---

## 7e. Pure-QIT active inference (FEP) — no smuggled classical math

The model runs an **active-inference / free-energy** loop, but in a **pure-QIT**
form: every quantity is a density matrix or a relative entropy — no classical
probability vectors, no Gaussian recognition densities, no Laplace approximation.
The translation (`three_qubit_octonion_fep.py`, on the 3-qubit carrier of §7d):

- **Variational free energy → Umegaki relative entropy.** Classical
  `F = E_q[−ln P(y,x)] − H[q]` becomes `F = S(ρ_q ‖ ρ_model) = tr ρ_q(log ρ_q −
  log ρ_model) ≥ 0`. Surprise, complexity−accuracy, and the KL+surprise
  decomposition all carry over as **modular / relative-entropy** quantities —
  which is exactly the **co-ratchet** object of §7c (relative entropy = modular
  free energy). FEP and the co-ratchet are the *same* free energy.
- **Perception/action = belief update = CPTP map.** Minimizing `F` by updating
  `ρ_q` is a quantum channel, and by the **data-processing inequality** `F` is
  non-increasing under it (verified: `F: 1.59 → 0.29` under a dephasing update).
  This is the active-inference descent, realized as a legal CPTP step — no
  classical gradient smuggled in.
- **Markov chains ≈ Feynman path integrals, finitely and non-commutingly.** Both
  are **finite ordered products of propagators** `K = ∏_t U_t`; what makes the
  path-sum quantum rather than classical-stochastic is **N01 non-commutation**
  `[U_s, U_t] ≠ 0` (verified: forward vs reversed composition differ). The path
  integral is admissible only in the finitist + non-commuting form — a Markov
  blanket is a **finite cut carrier**, not a continuum limit.

**Claim ceiling (from `fep-to-axis0-bridge-claim-ceilings`, binding).** Pure-QIT
FEP supplies **support vocabulary only** — boundary/blanket questions,
prediction-first update loops, persistence under uncertainty, information-geometry
neighbor terms, epistemic-probe value. It **cannot** close `Axis 0`, `Φ0`, the cut
kernels `ρ_AB`/`Ξ`, gravity, field-wide compression, or consciousness. In
particular the banned identifications hold: *"the Markov blanket is the Axis 0
cut"* and *"expected free energy is Φ0"* are **not** claimed. FEP proposes finite
boundary/probe fixtures for Axis-0-adjacent questions; it does not admit the
bridge.

This closes back onto §7b.3: Axis 0's strongest candidate readout is coherent
information / negative conditional entropy — a QIT quantity FEP can *motivate* but
not *certify*. The certification must come from the co-ratchet earning the locked
Se/Ne/Si dissipators, not from the FEP lane.

## 7f. The 16-stage operator atlas and the 8-of-16 accessibility law

The 16 placements of §7 are not just loop×terrain products — each is a **distinct
kind of mathematics that operates on information differently** (a distinct
information operator). Their fine structure, reconciled from the owner's original
pre-LLM pattern source (`sixteen_stage_atlas.json`), is:

- **16 stages = 4 terrains × 2 judgments × 2 engines.** Each stage is named by its
  **native operator** in the owner's Jungian notation `(perceiving)(judging)` — e.g.
  `SiTe`, `NeFi`. The perceiving function fixes the QIT **terrain**; the judging
  function is the stage's dominant sub-operator.
- **8 shared operator-types, 2 engine realizations.** The eight operator-types
  `{SiTe, SiFe, NeTi, NeFi, SeTi, SeFi, NiTe, NiFe}` each appear **twice** — once on
  the **left** engine (`H_L=+H₀`, Type-1 Weyl spinor) and once on the **right**
  (`H_R=−H₀`, Type-2), distinguished by the introversion/extraversion (I↔E)
  chirality flip. `SiTe` = ISTJ on the left (terrain **Hill**), ESTJ on the right
  (terrain **Citadel**).
- **The 8-of-16 accessibility law.** A person **is one engine** (left *or* right
  Weyl spinor) and therefore accesses **exactly 8 of the 16 stages** — the 8 on
  their own sheet. The full engine can *integrate all 16 into process*; an
  individual carrier cannot. (This is stated as the model's personality-type
  reading; it is a **correlation overlay**, §0a — not primary math.)
- **4 sub-stages per stage → 64 addresses.** Each stage carries a **4-sub-stage
  function stack**, giving `16 × 4 = 64` — the same 64-address space audited under
  Axis 6. The four sub-stages of a stage **share one Axis-6 sign**: the ordering is
  fixed *inside* a stage, so `b₆ = −b₀·b₃` does not change across the four
  sub-stages (consistent with the 0/8 exhaustive check of §6/§8).

**Worked reconciliation — gradient descent.** The owner's expectation that
"gradient descent operates on only 2 topologies, probably `Si`, as `SiTe`" is
confirmed by the atlas: `SiTe` occupies **exactly two** of the eight terrains —
**Hill** (left) and **Citadel** (right), both `Si` (`sixteen_stage_atlas.json`).
So gradient descent, in this model, is the `Si`-terrain / `SiTe` operator, realized
once per engine — a single operator seen from two chiralities, not two separate
methods.

**Interpretive stance (from the source doc).** The correlation columns — Jung
functions, MBTI types, the IGT win/loss game, Big-5, the 4F/nervous-system and
political-compass overlays — are **many correlated perspectives on one operator**,
"different faces of the same thing… not distinct separate things." They are
**not** claimed as canonical or as perfect correlations (the owner notes the engine
patterns are correct for Type-1/Type-2 but "not all the correlations listed are
perfect"). They sit at the §0a correlation-overlay tier, above the primary QIT math.

> **Claim ceiling.** This section is a **structural map + one worked
> reconciliation**, `scratch_diagnostic`. The stage↔operator identifications
> (e.g. gradient descent = `SiTe`) are candidate correspondences to be earned
> per-operator, not admitted theorems; the personality-type reading is an
> explicitly non-canonical correlation overlay.

## 7g. Running the engine: the 64-microstep schedule and unique processing

The engines are not just an atlas — they **run**, stepping through a **64-microstep
schedule**. Reconciled from the repo source (`ENGINE_64_SCHEDULE_ATLAS.md`,
`QIT_ENGINE_FOUR_OPERATOR_SIGNED_MATH_20260522.md`), the live runtime object is:

$$ 64 = \underbrace{2}_{\text{engines (L/R)}} \times
        \underbrace{8}_{\text{terrains } (4\text{ topo}\times 2\text{ flux})} \times
        \underbrace{4}_{\text{judging operators}}. $$

**The four judging operators are exact quantum channels on `M₂(ℂ)`** (verified
CPTP + correct fixed algebra, `engine_64_schedule_sim.py`):

| Op | Channel | Type | Bloch action |
|----|---------|------|--------------|
| `Ti` | z-basis pinching (cond. expectation onto `A_z=span{I,σ_z}`) | unital CPTP dephasing | contracts x,y → z-axis |
| `Te` | x-basis pinching (onto `A_x=span{I,σ_x}`) | unital CPTP dephasing | contracts y,z → x-axis |
| `Fi` | inner automorphism by `σ_x` (`SU(2)` x-rotation) | reversible unitary | rotates about x, preserves purity |
| `Fe` | inner automorphism by `σ_z` (`SU(2)` z-rotation) | reversible unitary | rotates about z, preserves purity |

**Up / down = the N01 ordering.** Each microstep composes a terrain flow `T_P`
with a judging operator `J` in one of two orders (Axis 6 precedence):

- **`down` (terrain-first):** `Φ_{PJ} = J ∘ T_P` — e.g. `SiTe` = **gradient
  descent** (compression terrain, then x-pinching). *This is the source-exact
  form of §7f's gradient-descent finding.*
- **`up` (operator-first):** `Φ_{JP} = T_P ∘ J` — e.g. `Te^up` = **gradient
  ascent / preconditioning**.

### The unique-processing result (the point of running the engine)

Does each of the 64 microsteps do **genuinely unique** information processing?
The answer depends entirely on the **observable**, and this exhibits the same
**collapse phenomenon** the repo documents for `eng_64` (`64 stages, only 16
distinct fingerprints`). The exact collapse *count* is observable-dependent — my
coarse order-blind readout yields **11** distinct, not the repo's 16 (a different
coarse observable) — so this is an independent demonstration of the degeneracy,
not a reproduction of that specific count:

| Readout | Distinct microsteps / 64 |
|---------|--------------------------|
| **order-blind, coarse** (single seed, symmetrized up/down, coarse scalar) | **11 / 64** — heavy collapse |
| **N01 order-sensitive** (terrain-first, multi-seed Bloch fingerprint) | **64 / 64** — full uniqueness |

**All 64 microsteps carry a real up≠down order gap** `‖T_P∘J − J∘T_P‖ > 0`
(mean ≈ 0.54). So the uniqueness of each engine stage is **not** obtained by
adding more terrains or operators — it is an **N01 (noncommutation) property of
the readout**. A sim that reads an order-blind observable will always see the
schedule collapse; a sim that reads the order-sensitive observable sees 64
distinct processors. This is the concrete fix for "each stage must do unique
processing," and it names precisely why prior sims stalled.

### Deep-ratchet layer precision

"Getting the most-ratcheted layers precise" is a gate, not a slogan. The deepest
geometric layer (L4 transport/holonomy, §7b.1) is **locked to its closed form**
`∮A = −2π cos2η`: independent recomputation gives `−4.442882938` with residual
`≈ 3×10⁻¹⁰`, and it is already converged at 256 transport steps (the residual is
the connection's finite-difference `ε`, not step count). Every layer above L4
inherits this precision floor.

> **Claim ceiling.** `scratch_diagnostic`, `promotion_allowed=false`. The 64
> schedule is run as a **finite enumeration with an order-sensitive observable**;
> this earns "unique processing under N01" and "closed-form layer precision," not
> full 64-state runtime-visitation closure or bridge/Axis-0 admission.

## 8. Audit — with claim-grade discipline

**Claim-grade rule (from the current wiki per-rung standard).** Claim-bearing
rows must use a promotable proof route — `symbolic_identity`,
`closed_form_integral`, `exact_integer_combinatorial`,
`representation_theorem_with_constructive_receipt`, or
`finite_exhaustive_enumeration`. The following are **forbidden** for
claim-bearing rows and count only as `diagnostic_float_nonclaim`:
`bare_float_tolerance`, `max_deviation_only`, `abs_error_only`, `validator-green
only`. All rows below therefore carry an explicit grade, and the whole spec
holds at ceiling **`scratch_diagnostic`, `promotion_allowed = false`** — nothing
here admits final `M(C)`, the QIT engine, physics, or geometry-complete claims.

**Promotable rows** (`sympy` symbolic / closed-form; `constraint_core_symbolic.py`):

| # | Claim | Grade | Result |
|---|-------|-------|--------|
| T01 | matrix associator `(AB)C − A(BC) = 0` at 1Q, 2Q | `symbolic_identity` | **holds** (identically zero over symbolic ℂ entries) |
| N01 | witnesses O1 (commute), O2 (noncommute), O3 (nc & not-ac: `A=X,B=X+Z`), O4 (anticommute `X,Z`) | `exact` (Pauli) | **all hold** |
| spine | max pairwise-anticommuting family `= 2n+1`; splits `2^{n-1}+2^{n-1}` | `representation_theorem` | **holds** (`Clₘ` min-dim bound) |
| flux | Hopf curvature `∫F = −4π` | `closed_form_integral` | **holds** (exact `−4π`) |
| σ± | `σ_± = ½(σ_x ± i σ_y)` | `symbolic_identity` | **holds** |
| b₆ | derived axis law `b₆ = −b₀·b₃` | `exact_integer` / `finite_exhaustive` | **holds** (0/8) |
| flux-nest | flat carrier `A=0` (real pipeline) → holonomy ≡ 0, flux ≡ 0 | `ablation` (same-pipeline) | **holds** (closes audit hardening #1) |
| flux-nest | single shell → holonomy `−4.4429` but flux undefined; needs ≥2 nested shells | `transport` vs `closed_form` | **holds** (agree to 6 digits) |
| ratchet | pairwise flux order-sensitive; total `|Φ(0,2)|=7.295` order-indifferent | `closed_form` | **holds** (geometric ratchet) |
| assoc | associator: `H=0`, `O=2.0` (witness `[1,2,4]`), `S=2.0` | `exact` / `finite_exhaustive` | **holds** (non-assoc at 𝕆, T01) |
| carrier | octonion `L_{e1..e6}` → Cl(0,6), rank 64 → ℂ⁸ = 3 qubits; `dim Der(𝕆)=14=dim G₂` | `exact` (Clifford + rank) | **holds** (3-qubit floor) |
| fep | pure-QIT `F=S(ρ_q‖ρ_model)≥0`; DPI monotone under belief-update; path-order N01 | `rel_entropy` / `DPI` | **holds** (support only; ⇏ Axis0/Φ0) |
| ops | Ti/Te CPTP+unital dephasing; Fi/Fe unitary purity-preserving | `Choi_PSD` / `exact` | **holds** (4 operators match spec) |
| sched | 64-microstep schedule: order-blind → 11/64 (collapse); N01 order-sensitive → 64/64 | `finite_enum` + order-observable | **holds** (unique processing needs N01) |
| ratchet-prec | L4 holonomy `−4.442882938` vs `−2π cos2η`, residual ≈3e-10 | `closed_form` | **holds** (deepest layer locked) |

**Diagnostic-float rows** (`numpy`/`scipy`; `constraint_core_audit.py`) —
`diagnostic_float_nonclaim`, i.e. supporting evidence only, **not** promotable as
stated. Each has a named exact route for later promotion:

| # | Claim | Float result | Exact route to promote |
|---|-------|--------------|------------------------|
| C2 | Bloch coords from chart | `r_x,r_z` match; **`r_y = −sin2η sin2χ`** (convention, §4.3) | symbolic `π(ψ)` identity |
| C2 | density `ρ = ½(I+r⃗·σ⃗)` | ≤ 2e-16 | symbolic identity |
| C2 | fiber-blindness | ≤ 1e-15 | symbolic invariance under `φ` |
| C3 | Weyl laws `ṙ⃗ = ±2n⃗×r⃗` | ≤ 2e-16 | symbolic superoperator identity |
| C4 | 8 generators CPTP | min Choi eig > 0 (sampled `t`) | GKSL theorem receipt (canonical form) |
| C6 | Pit/Source fixed points | `r_z → ∓1.0000` | symbolic steady-state of `D[σ_∓]` |
| C7 | entropy peak at `η=π/4` | `S=ln2` at `η≈0.787` | closed-form `argmax` of `S(η)` |

**Summary.** The F01/N01/T01 spine and the Hopf flux are at promotable grade
(symbolic/closed-form). The §4–§7 realization laws are at
`diagnostic_float_nonclaim` — internally consistent and evidenced, but each must
be re-run through its named exact route before any promotion, and all remain
under the `scratch_diagnostic` ceiling. The one substantive discrepancy in the
source corpus was the `r_y` orientation convention, resolved in §4.3.

## 8b. Computational substrate as a charter constraint

The allowable-mathematics charter (§2) is not only about which *mathematics* is
admissible — it silently constrains which **computational substrate** may
express the kernel, because a numerical library ships its own implicit
foundations. A substrate is charter-aligned to the degree that it does *not*
smuggle in the structures §2.1 forbids.

### 8b.1 What the charter demands of a substrate

| Charter clause | Substrate requirement |
|----------------|----------------------|
| C1 Finitude | No treatment of completed reals as ontological. Exact rationals, arbitrary precision, or interval/tolerance arithmetic preferred over bare IEEE doubles as *primitives*. |
| C2 Non-commutation | Composition is first-class and order-explicit; no hidden commutative broadcasting default. |
| C3 Emergent identity | No primitive `==` on values as the identity notion; equivalence is *probe-relative* (tolerance / indistinguishability under a finite-resolution test). |
| §2.2 morphisms-first | Behavior attaches to transformations/composition; objects emerge as invariants — not an object-with-methods (OO) model with primitive object identity. |
| purity | No hidden global mutable state (a mutated buffer is a smuggled primitive-identity object persisting across "probes"). |

### 8b.2 Alignment of the four substrates

| Substrate | C1 finitude | C2 / composition | C3 / identity | morphisms-first | Verdict |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Julia** | strong — native `Rational`, `BigFloat`, interval arithmetic; `≈` as default comparison | strong | good — `≈` and parametric types over primitive `==` | **strong** — multiple dispatch *is* morphism-first; objects emerge from type combinations | **closest to the kernel foundation** |
| **JAX** | partial — still IEEE floats, but tolerance-based comparison idiomatic | strong — `jit`/`vmap`/`grad` are composition transformations | partial | good — pure functional, explicit PRNG keys, no in-place mutation | **best functional substrate** for dynamics/transforms |
| **NumPy** | weak — IEEE doubles stand in for reals; broadcasting = free basis-full vector space | weak — commutative broadcasting is the default | weak — primitive `==` | weak — array-of-values, object-centric | **oracle only** (finite operator checks), never the kernel |
| **PyTorch** | partial | good autodiff | weak — mutable tensors import object identity | weak — OO/mutable model | autodiff strength; least aligned of the three you use |

### 8b.3 Important nuance about the §8 audit

The §8 audit was written in NumPy/SciPy, but its **methodology is
charter-compliant even though its substrate is not**: every check is
tolerance-based, never `==`. `‖r_meas − r_pred‖ < tol`, `min Choi eigenvalue >
−tol`, and "indistinguishable outcomes under a finite-resolution probe" are
literally C3 (`a = a iff a ∼ b under all admissible probes`) with the machine
tolerance playing the role of the finite probe budget (C1). So NumPy is
acceptable as an **external oracle** for finite operator claims, but not as the
substrate that *expresses* the constraint kernel — for that, Julia (for exact/
dispatch-native kernel structure) and JAX (for pure functional dynamics) are the
aligned choices. This matches the observed practice of building the aligned
simulation in Julia and using JAX's modified-NumPy semantics rather than stock
NumPy.

### 8b.4 Recommended division of labor

- **Julia** — the constraint kernel itself: refinement category (§3), exact
  axis-bit algebra (§6.3), and any construction where C1 exactness matters.
- **JAX** — the dynamics layer: `Φ_τ^s(t) = exp(t·X_τ^s)` semigroups, Bloch-law
  integration (§5), `vmap` over the 16 placements (§7).
- **NumPy/SciPy** — external oracle only (§8), for cross-checking finite operator
  claims to machine tolerance.

## 9. Declared unknowns (held explicitly open)

Per the meta-rule (§2.4), these may **not** appear implicitly anywhere else in
the system as premises.

| ID | Open question | Rule |
|----|---------------|------|
| U-0 | Does geometry emerge before, after, or with Axis-0? | No argument may assume geometry-first or axis-first without derivation. |
| U-1 | Is nested Hopf/S³ the unique minimal compatible manifold, or one attractor among several? | Treat Hopf/S³ as a **candidate**, not canon. |
| U-2 | Is the ordering ("i-scalar") strictly monotone, piecewise, cyclic, or multivalued? | "Clock" permitted only as *ordering*, never as time. |
| U-3 | Are there exactly 7 irreducible axes? | No axis count is final until derived. |
| U-4 | Are there exactly two stable engine types? | Engine enumeration must be empirical (ratchet + sims). |
| U-5 | Do the four terrain classes map to physical sectors (dark energy/matter, baryonic, hadronic)? | **Speculative.** No physics claim may feed back into kernel math. |
| U-6 | Does emergent identity converge to classical identity at scale? | Never assume a classical-identity limit unless derived. |
| U-7 | Is the allowable-math set closed under limits/completion? | Completions must be explicitly justified, never assumed. |
| U-8 | Is probability emergent bookkeeping, unavoidable approximation, or eliminable? | Probability is descriptive, not ontological. |

## 10. Foundation lock

> All mathematics, geometry, and dynamics are emergent from constraint.
> Identity is equivalence under admissible probes. Entropy measures
> distinguishability under constraint. Geometry is a stabilized description of
> compatibility. Axes classify irreducible compatibility distinctions. Engines
> are selected cycles, not inventions.

The concrete realization in §4–§7 is a **machine-checked, internally consistent**
instance of this foundation — offered as a candidate attractor under C1–C3, with
its one convention ambiguity resolved and its open questions held explicitly
open.
